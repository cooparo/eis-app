They’ve revived that classic debate: the hard path versus the soft path. The soft path, as Amory Lovins defined it in the 1970s, is energy conservation and power from the sun, wind and plants — the technologies that Senator Barack Obama emphasizes in his plan to reduce greenhouse emissions. Senator John McCain is more enthusiastic about building nuclear power plants, the quintessential hard path. As a rule, it’s not a good idea to revive anything from the 1970s. But this debate is the exception, and not just because the threat of global warming has raised the stakes. The old lessons are as good a guide as any to the future, as William Tucker argues in “ Terrestrial Energy ,” his history of the hard-soft debate. The initial debate over nuclear power seemed to end not long after the partial meltdown in 1979 of the reactor at Three Mile Island. Utilities canceled orders and stopped building reactors, partly because of public fears, but perhaps mainly because of rising costs. Mr. Lovins and his allies liked to say that nuclear power, once promoted as “too cheap to meter,” had now become “too expensive to matter.” The soft path seemed to be the way to go, particularly when some of Mr. Lovins’s predictions about energy conservation came true. As Americans cut back in response to higher prices and new incentives, the growth in electricity demand slowed. Some public officials, most enthusiastically in California, told utilities to stop building large power plants. Instead, they subsidized wind farms and solar power, which were supposed to be cheap and plentiful alternatives once the technologies matured. Instead, they remained so costly and scarce that Californians’ electricity rates were among the highest in America. They endured rolling blackouts in 2000 while paying astronomical prices for power from nuclear and fossil-fuel plants in other states. The crisis was attributed to price controls and Enron’s market manipulation, but the underlying problem was a shortage of power that forced the state to start building old-fashioned fossil-fuel plants for itself. Meanwhile, there was a surprise on the hard path, too. Once utilities stopped building reactors, the share of electricity from nuclear power was projected to decline steadily as the oldest reactors were retired. But then several new “merchant energy” companies began assembling fleets of reactors sold off by local utilities. The new owners standardized operations, retrained workers and brought in human-factor engineers to redesign the famously indecipherable control panels. Under the old owners, the reactors were balky white elephants operating only 60 percent of the time. By improving maintenance and preventing mistakes, the new owners kept them running 90 percent of the time and won permission to upgrade their capacities. So even as the nuclear industry was shrinking in the last two decades as the oldest reactors shut down, the remaining ones were profitably generating an increasing share of the country’s electricity. Today about 20 percent of electricity in America is generated by nuclear power, which is about 20 times the contribution from solar and wind power. Nuclear power also costs less, according to Gilbert Metcalf , an economist at Tufts University. After estimating the costs and factoring out the hefty tax breaks for different forms of low-carbon energy, he estimates that new nuclear plants could produce electricity more cheaply than windmills, solar power or “clean coal” plants. The outlook could change, of course, if new nuclear plants turn out to be more expensive than expected, or if engineers make breakthroughs in other technologies. (To debate these possibilities, go to www.nytimes.com/tierneylab.) Given the uncertainties, Dr. Metcalf cautions, it would be risky to bet everything on nuclear power as the answer to global warming. But it seems even riskier to bet on just the soft path, as so many greens are doing, either by flatly opposing nuclear power or by setting so many conditions that no plants could be built for decades, if ever. (Mr. Obama says nuclear power is necessary but should not be expanded until security and safety issues are addressed.) “The nuclear debate is still stuck back in the 1980s,” says Mr. Tucker, the author of “Terrestrial Energy,” the new brand he’s trying to affix to nuclear power. If people started associating nuclear plants with natural radioactive processes in the Earth instead of atomic bombs, he says, they might be persuaded that it’s the most environmentally benign form of energy, particularly compared with wind farms that cover scenic ridges and the vast solar arrays proposed for “empty” land in deserts. Mr. Tucker, a journalist who has been debunking environmental alarms for decades, says he has come around to Al Gore’s view on the danger of global warming, and he’d like environmentalists to rethink their views, too. “Even when greens give grudging support to nuclear power,” he says, “they add the caveat, ‘But first we have to make sure the plants are absolutely safe’ — as if reactors haven’t been operating safely for 25 years. Nobody recognizes the complete overhaul that has occurred in the industry or how it’s now pumping out twice as much electricity from the same plants with a vastly improved safety record.” By scaring people about the tiny levels of radiation emitted during the normal operation of a nuclear plant, Mr. Tucker says, greens have effectively encouraged the construction of coal plants that actually release more radiation because of the traces of uranium in coal dust. He argues that the risks of terrorist attacks and nuclear waste have been exaggerated, particularly by the environmentalists who objected when the Yucca Mountain nuclear-waste depository was being designed to guarantee a level of safety for only 10,000 years. They successfully sued to enforce a safety standard extending one million years — which, in an ideal world, would be a very nice standard. But if you believe global warming is a planetary crisis that must be addressed immediately, should you really be obsessing about hypothetical dangers near one mountain in A.D. 1,000,000? If there’s already a proven technology that doesn’t spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, why fiddle while coal burns?",2008-10-07T05:30:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science-science

Instead, power companies, in their greed, focused on profits. What could the power companies have been thinking when they built reactors on geologically active faults both in Japan and California? Although reactors need to be near a large body of water for cooling purposes, there are many such locations without active faults. Nuclear power can be a safe source of power, without carbon emissions, if we would only spend the money to make it safe. Since many countries have reactors, it makes sense to form a nuclear reactor consortium, financed by those countries with nuclear power, to do research on how to build safe reactors and how to dispose of nuclear waste. Too much time has already been spent on dealing with accidents that could have been avoided if we had the proper knowledge, and we are continually frustrated by the lack of a solution for waste disposal. Robert Ackerberg Massapequa, N.Y., March 22, 2011  To the Editor: Contrary to what Frank N. von Hippel writes in “ It Could Happen Here ” (Op-Ed, March 24), America’s nuclear power plants are well equipped to handle the impacts of severe events, whatever the cause. In recent years, nuclear plants have maintained safety in the direct path of Hurricanes Katrina and Andrew. Nonetheless, our industry is taking steps to make nuclear energy facilities even safer. Companies are verifying each power station’s capability to withstand conditions that result from severe events, including the loss of significant operational and safety systems. They are also verifying that the capability to maintain safety of reactors even in a total loss of electric power is proper and functional. The global nuclear industry is providing technical assistance and equipment as Japan continues to restore cooling systems at the Fukushima reactors. Significant changes after Three Mile Island have led to high safety and reliability at 104 reactors in the United States. As utilities do after significant events such as this, we will apply safety and security upgrades as warranted as part of our commitment to generate electricity safely and reliably. Scott Peterson Senior Vice President Nuclear Energy Institute Washington, March 24, 2011  To the Editor: Are we to take seriously Frank N. von Hippel’s argument that the ultimate deaths of a mere 10,000 people as a result of Chernobyl, compared with the tens of thousands of people killed by particulates from coal, suggest that the nuclear industry is “remarkably safe”? Mr. von Hippel’s assertion that running nuclear power plants is “relatively cheap” once construction costs have been paid conveniently ignores the costs of decommissioning, security for the plant post-closure and radioactive waste storage in perpetuity. Advocates for nuclear power who fail to address this staggering legacy of hidden costs are misleading the public. H. James Quigley Jr. Stony Brook, N.Y., March 24, 2011 The writer is a lecturer in the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook University.  To the Editor: The detection of radioactive iodine 131 in Tokyo’s drinking water (“ Anxiety Up as Tokyo Issues Warning on Its Tap Water ,” front page, March 24), in amounts considered unhealthy for children, makes clear that potassium iodide must be administered if children are to be adequately protected against thyroid cancer caused by ingested and inhaled iodine 131. Interdiction of milk supplies, though important, is plainly insufficient. Japan’s apparent preparedness with potassium iodide contrasts with the situation in the United States. In response to 9/11, Congress passed a law to create stockpiles of potassium iodide for populations within a 20-mile radius of nuclear reactors, rather than the 10-mile radius within which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission offers it to states that request it. But the N.R.C., which had opposed the law, fought successfully to keep it from taking effect. In 2008 President George W. Bush’s science adviser, John H. Marburger III, declared that potassium iodide was not needed beyond the 10-mile radius, and that the law therefore would not be implemented. The events in Japan demand that the Obama administration act quickly to reverse this unjustified rejection of a sensible law.

But this is a new era, dominated by fears of tight energy supplies and global warming. Suddenly nuclear power is looking better. The nuclear industry recently trotted out two new leaders of its campaign to encourage the building of new reactors. They are Christie Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace. This campaign is the latest sign that nuclear power is getting a more welcome reception from some environmentalists who have moved on to bigger worries. True, most environmental organizations remain adamantly opposed to any expansion of nuclear power and instead look to conservation and renewable energy to get us out of the fossil fuel age. But when the ecologist James Lovelock -- creator of the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth and all its organisms behave as if they were a single living system -- urges his colleagues to drop their ''wrongheaded opposition'' to nuclear energy, it is clear that fissures are developing. There is good reason to give nuclear power a fresh look. It can diversify our sources of energy with a fuel -- uranium -- that is both abundant and inexpensive. More important, nuclear energy can replace fossil-fuel power plants for generating electricity, reducing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute heavily to global warming. That could be important in large developing economies like China's and India's, which would otherwise rely heavily on burning large quantities of dirty coal and oil. But nuclear power should not be given a free pass in our frantic quest for energy and environmental security. Making any real dent in carbon emissions could require building many hundreds or even thousands of new nuclear plants around the world in coming decades, a hugely ambitious undertaking fraught with challenges. As nuclear expertise and technologies spread around the world, so does the risk that they might be used to make bombs. Unfortunately, the Bush administration erred badly when it signed a nuclear pact with India that would undercut the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. That misguided deal needs to be repudiated by the Senate. We can only hope that it does not undercut a more promising administration plan to keep the most dangerous fuel-making technologies out of circulation by supplying developing nations with uranium and taking the spent fuel rods back. There remains the unsolved problem of what to do with the radioactive waste generated by nuclear plants. Many people are unwilling to see a resurgence in nuclear power without some assurance that the spent fuel can be handled safely. The Energy Department's repeated setbacks in efforts to open an underground waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada do not inspire confidence, but there is no reason why the spent fuel rods can't be stored safely at surface sites for the next 50 to 100 years. More problematic is the administration's long-term solution for waste disposal. It wants to recycle the spent fuel in a new generation of advanced reactors that would use technologies that don't yet exist, following a timetable that many experts think unrealistic. Its current approach is apt to be costly and would leave dangerous plutonium more accessible to terrorists. Nuclear power has a good safety record in this country, and its costs, despite the high initial expense of building the plants, are looking more reasonable now that fossil fuel prices are soaring. How much impact it could really have in slowing carbon emissions has yet to be spelled out, but there is no doubt that nuclear power could serve as a useful bridge to even greener sources of energy.

Credit it for candor. Nuclear energy is a flop, and the power sources of the future will be sun, wind and water. They may be indeed, although the evidence is a shade less compelling than the otherwise intelligent documentary seems to think. It will be seen on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight. At the opening, Meryl Streep, the unseen narrator, describes the energy battle this way: ''The struggle pits the long-established use of limited and potentially hazardous resources against a mix of new technologies that rely on renewable resources like the sun.'' In a struggle like that, of course, we know which side we're supposed to be on. Only a lobbyist would prefer a limited and potentially hazardous resource over old Sol. Who wants acid rain, uppity oil sheiks and other unpleasantnesses? Meanwhile, as Miss Streep notes: ''Nuclear power has been attacked by its critics as unsafe for nearly three decades. Ironically, the nuclear industry has been more crippled in recent years by concerns over costs than over safety.'' This is true. The nuclear power industry has been afflicted by cost overruns, management failures and, its spokesmen insist, burdensome government regulations. At the same time, the nuclear power industry, although it has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, has had to battle cultural and political forces that hold it to be immoral. ''Power Struggle'' shows us representatives of Mothers for Peace and the Abalone Alliance, among others, making their cases. Therefore, it's worth noting, which the documentary barely does, that the rest of the world sees nuclear power differently. France, for example, expects its Government-run nuclear industry to meet 55 percent of the country's electrical energy needs by 1990. And grant that sun, wind and water are attractive possibilities; ''Power Struggle'' is still awfully zealous in its determination to promote them. Thus it gives us a ''renewable-energy advocate'' who says the nuclear energy industry misspent the best part of $125 billion. He may be correct; a cover story in Forbes magazine used that same figure last February. Then, however, he speaks of the industry's ''$75 billion in Federal subsidies.'' All this, he says, led to ''the greatest tragedy in our whole industrial history.'' In fact, the nuclear power industry does not get Federal subsidies, and the $75 billion figure is made of blue smoke. Later we are told that the construction of nuclear plants has been ''70 percent subsidized,'' a figure equally murky. ''Power Struggle'' -a Public Policy Production - seems so fearful the mismanaged nuclear industry will rise from the ashes that it must bury it any way it can. This is unnecessary because ''Power Struggle,'' when it gets down to cases, does have interesting things to say about alternative energy. It shows us, for example, the solar thermal plant of Southern California Edison - 1,800 mirrors in the Mojave Desert that concentrate the sun's rays into a boiler that produces steam. It also shows us Altamont Pass in California, the largest ''wind farm'' in the world. Thousands of windmills are harnessed to produce electricity. Are projects like these the hope of the future? ''Power Struggle'' isn't entirely persuasive, but certainly it's provocative. The examination is worthwhile.",1985-12-17T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,cultural-desk-movies

Even before the radioactive dust flung skyward by a burning Soviet reactor has settled, new fears about the safety of nuclear power are being voiced around the world. Students of the nuclear industry said that some countries, especially France and Japan, would probably forge ahead with plans to expand nuclear energy despite the Soviet disaster, both because they believe their technologies to be safe and because they face little serious public opposition. But experts predicted that construction of new nuclear plants would be curtailed elsewhere. In Western Europe, the Soviet disaster has added new kindling to already fiery debates about the future of nuclear power. With the exception of France, the nuclear industry in Western Europe has been stagnating, with little new construction and few orders for future plants. A Slackening of Demand The industry's woes have been attributed to economic factors, including a slackening of projected electrical demand and high interest rates as well as a surge in public concern about safety in the wake of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. Now, in the shadow of a far worse accident that has sprinkled several countries with radioactive fallout, Western European opposition to nuclear energy seems certain to widen and deepen, experts believe. ''In Europe outside France, the effect on future reactor orders is going to be paralyzing,'' said Andrew Holmes, editor of European Energy Report, a newsletter published in London. ''This accident will make it far more difficult for new plants to be built,'' said David Albright, a nuclear specialist at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. A Positive View of Prospects But a spokesman for the American nuclear power industry expressed a more positive view. ''I don't think the Soviet accident will sharply reduce the growth of nuclear power,'' said Eugene Gantzhorn of the Atomic Industrial Forum in New York. He noted that nearly all commercial reactors in other countries used a safer technology than the Soviet plant, which has graphite core reactors that are seldom built in the West and lack containment buildings to deter the escape of radiation. ''I believe common sense will prevail, and this will not stop needed nuclear power programs around the world,'' Mr. Gantzhorn said. Nuclear power now provides 15 percent of the world's electricity. Mr. Holmes, speaking by telephone, predicted that the Soviet accident might derail nuclear plans in four countries that were on the verge of ordering new reactors - the Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Britain. He said the accident had strengthened opponents of nuclear energy in additional countries, including West Germany and Switzerland. He said the accident could slow the planned expansion, with Soviet assistance, of nuclear energy in Eastern Europe, a region lacking in domestic energy resources. East European Voices Concern Yesterday an East European diplomat observed that a plant identical to the stricken Chernobyl station was under construction in his country. ''What are we supposed to do now?'' the diplomat asked in frustration. He said some East European countries had formed committees to examine the implications of the Soviet disaster for their own energy futures. The Soviet Union has laid plans to more than double nuclear energy output in the next five years, to nearly 70,000 megawatts, from 28,000 megawatts in operation at the end of 1985. Soviet energy planners consider the growth of nuclear capacity essential in the European regions of their country, which are getting short on fossil fuel sources, and Western experts declined to speculate about how Moscow's staunchly pro-nuclear policy might be affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Three European countries have rejected nuclear power in recent years. In 1978, Austria decided not to open an already built reactor, while Sweden, after the Three Mile Island incident, decided to phase out its 10 existing reactors by 2010. Last year Denmark decided to forgo the nuclear option. German Debate Intensifies In West Germany, which depends on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity, this week's disaster intensifed a debate over nuclear power. On Wednesday, the Green Party renewed its antinuclear campaign at a news conference, displaying signs reading, ''Chernobyl Is Everywhere,'' evoking signs held by demonstrators after the Three Mile Island accident that said ''Harrisburg Is Everywhere.'' The West German Government said the Soviet accident would have no effect on plans to add five more reactors to the 20 already operating. But some observers predicted that the antinuclear forces, especially vocal in the 1970's, would be strengthened anew. Nuclear power development in Britain has been stalled for years by a debate over what type of, if any, new reactors should be built. At a minimum, the Soviet accident appeared likely to delay still longer an awaited decision by the Government, after three years of hearings and debate, over whether to build Britain's first pressurized water reactor, a Westinghouse model that is a departure from previously built gas-cooled reactors. Nuclear reactors are also manufactured by General Electric, Babcock & Wilcox and Combustion Engineering of the United States; Siemens-Kraftwerk Union of West Germany, Framatome of France, British General Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., as well as by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Britain Affirms Its Policy An official in the Prime Minister's office said it was ''ludicrous'' to suggest that British energy policy would be deflected by the Soviet accident, but opponents of nuclear power are mounting new protests. ''I think this may have tipped the balance against nuclear development here,'' said Mr. Holmes, the London energy analyst. France has been opening reactors at a rate of four a year, but the pace of construction is expected to slow, not because of qualms about the technology but because reactors already under construction are expected to meet most of the projected electricity needs. France derives nearly two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power. The Soviet accident ''is not leading us to change our activities or policies,'' Michel Lajus, head of a Government committee on nuclear safety said this week. Effective public opposition has not emerged. Japan Is One-Fourth Nuclear Japan now gains more than a quarter of its electricity from 32 nuclear reactors. Eleven more are under construction and six others are planned. Opponents of nuclear power wield little political influence and experts doubted whether the Chernobyl disaster would slow the push for more nuclear energy in Japan, which is totally dependent on imports for oil.",1986-05-02T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world
