[{"body":"On the corner of New York’s Park Avenue and 52nd Street, curious onlookers recently stopped in front of a giant green skull sitting in the bed of a truck parked outside the office of Fidelity Investments, the global financial management company. The “Skull of Satoshi”, named after the pseudonymous bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto, is composed almost entirely of computer circuit boards and fitted with tall smokestacks usually found atop coal power plants. The artifact is a project of artist Benjamin Von Wong and is a reference to the massive amounts of carbon emitted from mining the cryptocurrency bitcoin, an endeavor Fidelity is now pursuing. Bitcoin is chiefly known as a wild investment vehicle that – along with many other cryptocurrencies – can seemingly make or lose fortunes overnight in a market where values go up and down quickly and by large margins. But what worries environmentalists and others is the huge amount of electricity used in generating bitcoin and other such currencies – energy that often traces back to fossil fuels and so has a corresponding impact on the climate crisis. As major financial brands speculate in the cryptocurrency world, environmental campaigners want to make sure they know that they are not just taking a financial gamble; there is also an environmental risk. Some are hoping that they can persuade those institutions to try to lessen the impact of crypto-mining. “It’s a big step for a financial institution like Fidelity to launch their own crypto platform. So now more than ever, we need their help,” said Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA, a non-profit environmental advocacy organization. It is a complex situation. But here is a guide to the key issues. What is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a decentralized form of currency that is strictly digital rather than physical – unlike dollars, pounds or euros. It is managed and traded on a public, open ledger known as a “blockchain” that records all bitcoin transactions. Though not commonly done, bitcoin can be used to buy material goods. How does bitcoin cause environmental damage? Because cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not centralized, there is no singular authority or body to verify transactions. Instead, participants in the bitcoin network “mine”, or compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to generate more of the currency. Whoever solves the puzzle the fastest gets to verify transactions for the chance to add the newest batch of them to the blockchain. The winner is financially rewarded with new cryptocurrency in this process, referred to as “proof of work” (PoW) – the culprit for greenhouse gas emissions. The PoW consensus algorithm used to verify transactions requires large amounts of electricity which is often produced by burning fossil fuels, emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. A 2022 report, titled Revisiting Bitcoin’s Carbon Footprint, conducted by climate and economics researchers across Europe estimates that “Bitcoin mining may be responsible for 65.4 megatonnes of CO2 per year … which is comparable to country-level emissions in Greece (56.6 megatonnes in 2019).” What do environmental groups want? There is a recent push by some environmentalists to reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin by changing the way it is produced. So groups such as Greenpeace are calling out Fidelity and other financial management and payment process companies that have ventured into bitcoin mining. Hence the recent targeting of Fidelity. Skar said that although Fidelity responded to Greenpeace when the group reached out, the response was lackluster. “[Fidelity] seem not to want to talk about the issue. They declined [our request to speak] so far, but it’s an invitation for them and others to step up and put resources towards solutions to deal with the problem of bitcoin mining globally. We think it can be done,” Skar said. How could ‘changing the code’ mitigate environmental damage? The solution, Greenpeace argues, is simple: change the computer code that produces bitcoin in order to consume less electricity and reduce its carbon footprint. This code is open-source, meaning it is publicly accessible to anyone who wants to see or use it. Rather than a PoW verification process, which requires vast amounts of energy, climate activists are arguing for a less energy-intensive verification process that isn’t reliant on speed, such as “proof of stake” (PoS), used by ethereum – another cryptocurrency. How is this Fidelity’s problem? Since bitcoin is decentralized, it has no owner and no one to hold to account for problems the cryptocurrency creates, like wreaking havoc on the environment. The activists advocating for a code change to bitcoin argue that popular financial services corporations like Fidelity have the clout to incentivize such a change, which would be environmentally transformative. “[Fidelity] doesn’t have a climate commitment like other asset managers. Fidelity is the focus because they have been one of the biggest traditional financial players involved in the bitcoin space and they refuse to acknowledge that they have a responsibility and the ability to help fix the problem that bitcoin mining is having on the climate. So this is actually an invitation for them,” Skar said. He called the code change “a win for bitcoin and for climate and for communities”. But would it succeed? Prominent voices in the bitcoin community and some scholars on the topic don’t buy into this solution. Dr Hanna Halaburda is an associate professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU’s Stern School of Business. Among the classes she teaches are Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and Foundations of Fintech. In reference to a hypothetical bitcoin protocol change, Halaburda said: “I don’t think it’s going to work. Everybody recognizes [bitcoin] is environmentally unhealthy, but any big changes to bitcoin protocol have been very unsuccessful because you need to get all the miners to agree on that.” Any miners that don’t agree with the protocol change can simply reject the new code and continue running the original code that relies on the energy-intensive PoW. Would other tactics work? Halaburda said there might be another solution: renewable energy. “A lot of [bitcoin] mining companies have set up their contracts with renewable energy companies. The argument is that having these mining facilities as clients means that when there’s an oversupply of energy, it may actually make it more profitable for the renewable energy plants,” she said. This means that these energy companies can mine bitcoin during periods of excess production and oversupply. So instead of letting energy go to waste, money can be made and the wealth can be shared between the cryptocurrency mining facilities and the renewable energy companies with which they have a contract. Fidelity did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.","publicationTime":1682499603.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin is terrible for the environment – can it ever go green?","id":"technology/2023/apr/26/bitcoin-mining-climate-crisis-environmental-impact"},{"body":"A sharp rise in bitcoin prices has pushed the cryptocurrency above $30,000 (£24,118) for the first time since 10 June last year, just before the Celsius crypto lending company froze withdrawals in the run-up to its collapse. Even given that recovery, the token is still well below its all-time high of $68,000 in November 2021, and far below where it was before the failure of the Terra stablecoin caused the “crypto winter”. Nevertheless, bitcoin’s recent steady increase in value has sparked discussion of another cryptocurrency boom – and reignited fears of widespread manipulation in the market. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month and the broader contagion it has sparked across financial markets led some cryptocurrency fans to turn to bitcoin, the original and most valuable token in the sector, as a way of protecting against fears that the entire traditional “fiat” economy would crumble. That attitude was typified by the US venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan, who in March bet $1m that the price of a single bitcoin would top $1m by June this year. His claim was that the US dollar would shortly experience hyperinflation, causing the dollar value of a bitcoin to soar. “This is the moment that the world redenominates on bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century,” he tweeted, explaining the bet. “Everything will happen very fast once people check what I’m saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.” Alex Adelman, the chief executive of the bitcoin rewards app Lolli, said Monday’s rally “did not have a clear catalyst”, but that it was “a bellwether of bitcoin’s newly bullish market conditions and strong investor confidence. Bitcoin’s ongoing strength suggests that bitcoin is emerging from so-called ‘crypto winter’ into a new phase of strength and renewed interest from retail and institutional investors.” But the recovery, after bitcoin prices hovered at $28,000 for almost a month before leaping the final $2,000 in a day, has also led to concern about market manipulation. A 2022 report published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research found that “wash trading”, the practice of selling cryptocurrencies between related parties to influence the reported price, averaged “over 70% of the reported volume” on 29 unregulated exchanges. In June 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refused permission to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange traded fund, which would allow investors to buy exposure to the cryptocurrency on the public stock markets, after concluding that it was impossible to prevent fraud and manipulation in the market from affecting the price. As well as wash trading, the SEC said the market could be influenced by individuals with a “dominant position” in bitcoin manipulating its pricing, through fraud and manipulation at trading platforms, and through manipulative activity involving stablecoins “including tether”.","publicationTime":1681211745.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin price rises above $30,000 for first time since June 2022","id":"technology/2023/apr/11/bitcoin-price-rises-usd-cyptocurrency-value"},{"body":"As fraud and conspiracy charges were laid against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the US on Tuesday, a funny thing happened to the price of bitcoin: it went up. Since bitcoin is still a handy barometer of sentiment in the whole crypto universe, one must assume that more than a few punters saw headlines about “one of the biggest frauds in American history” – the US attorney for the Southern District of New York’s description of Bankman-Fried’s alleged crimes – and decided this was just the moment to top up their bets. Bitcoin has still plunged in value by almost two-thirds this year, it should be said. But it has also rallied by about 10% since the downwards lurch when FTX filed for bankruptcy in mid-November, which is extraordinary. One has to wonder: what are crypto’s true believers still smoking? A popular narrative says a few accidents (to grossly understate the significance of FTX’s failure) are merely to be expected in the early years of a multi-decade financial revolution. The odd trading exchange might go pop but, hey, the most popular digital tokens should survive. And, when regulators eventually impose a few rules in crypto’s wild west, mainstream respectability will be secured, runs the theorising. This cheerful spin sounds delusional. Whether or not Bankman-Fried is convicted, FTX looks an existential event for the crypto trading fad. As mediums of exchange in the real world of goods and services, none of the digital tokens has achieved lift-off, aside from their use in “terrorism financing, tax avoidance and sex trafficking”, as JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon put it on CNBC last week. As stores of value in inflationary times – the “digital gold” idea – they’ve flopped. And they yield no income, obviously. That leaves cryptocurrencies as tools of pure speculation, a pitch with limited appeal if it is proved that $8bn worth of customers’ assets are missing from FTX. Yes, the firm smack of regulatory discipline may eventually force the creation of exchanges with proper governance structures that follow know-your-customer rules and don’t entwine their operations with hedge funds or lending vehicles. By that time, though, one suspects the get-rich-quick crew will have moved on to something else. Tulips were big until they weren’t. The underlying blockchain-based technology should still have useful financial applications, it is usually obligatory to point out, but the fall of Bankman-Fried feels like the moment when grown-up thinking re-enters the room. “Crypto is a complete sideshow” and crypto tokens are like “pet rocks”, Dimon also said last week. It was a boring and conventional thing for the boss of a big bank to say, but also surely correct. A new class of asset, as we normally use the term, has not been created. Good luck to the buyers and holders of bitcoin at $18,000, but you have been warned (again). A big idea blossoms from small energy savings A saving of £2.8m is tiny in the context of the many extra billions that UK households will be spending on energy this winter, but good ideas can have small beginnings. National Grid’s “demand flexibility service” – the scheme to incentivise us to use our tumble dryers and other appliances outside peak hours – is one such innovation. The company, as operator of the electricity network, was merely running a series of limited trials to establish that the flexibility setup works – thus the small number. But the response by consumers seems to have beaten expectations; and the fact that 1m households and firms have signed up to participate in any wider rollout suggests there is appetite to save a few quid. From the Grid’s point of view, the arrangement is about shifting demand to meet supply. There will clearly be limits to how much balancing and fine-tuning can be achieved in practice, and the job of setting financial incentives may prove to be more art than science. But it does all sound like an outbreak of common sense, as well being a small return on the hideously expensive rollout of smart meters. It’s just a shame it took an energy crisis to get it going. A proper national insulation would provide a far bigger improvement in energy efficiency, of course, but that’s not Grid’s lookout.","publicationTime":1671043381.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin has rallied.

In a strongly worded blogpost, senior European Central Bank (ECB) staffers Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf criticised bitcoin for being a hotbed of illegal transactions that brings reputational risk for any bank that gets involved with the sector. The value of the digital currency has plummeted from a peak of almost $70,000, stabilising at about $20,000, but has fallen to a low of $16,000 since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. But the ECB authors say even this stabilisation is likely to be false, an artefact of market manipulation rather than genuine demand. “Big bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going,” they wrote. “The manipulations by individual exchanges or stablecoin providers etc. during the first waves are well documented, but less so the stabilising factors after the supposed bursting of the bubble in spring.” In the article, which was first published as an opinion piece in the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Bindseil and Schaaf argue that the speculative bubble in bitcoin value led to an explosion in lobbying from the cryptocurrency sector that aimed to treat crypto as “just another asset class”. In fact, they write, “the risks of crypto assets are undisputed among regulators”. “Since bitcoin appears to be neither suitable as a payment system nor as a form of investment, it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimised,” the blogpost concludes. The intervention sparked immediate pushback from those inside the bitcoin community. Investor Eric Voorhees said that the line declaring the currency “artificially inflated” would be “set in a beautiful typeface, ornately displayed on heavy matte paper, and hung elegantly upon my wall”, while venture capitalist Mike Dudas contrasted the post with a chart showing the euro’s 20% decline against the dollar since 2021, arguing that it was the euro that was on the road to “irrelevance”. (In the same period, bitcoin has fallen against the euro by more than 60%). It is one of the strongest interventions yet against bitcoin, and by extension the wider cryptocurrency sector, by a leading regulator. After FTX’s spectacular failure, authorities around the world have questioned whether light-touch regulation of the cryptocurrency sector could be causing real harm to consumers. Inside the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA) is one attempt to impose stricter requirements on the sector. The rules, which are likely to be voted into law in February, will impose new consumer protection requirements on EU-based crypto companies. The Bank of England’s deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, on Monday called for regulation, in softer terms than the ECB, telling an audience at Warwick Business School: “We should not wait until it is large and connected to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary to prevent a crypto shock that could have a much greater destabilising impact.” But the bank is hindered in its ability to take action by the prime minister’s strong backing of crypto. When he was chancellor in April 2021, Rishi Sunak launched a taskforce to examine the potential of a digital pound, and a year later he asked the Royal Mint to create the government’s first NFT. That token has still not been sold to the public, although the overall size of the crypto market has fallen by about 70% since Sunak issued the order. • This article was amended on 1 December 2022 to clarify that the value of the digital currency had fallen to a low of $16,000 since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX.","publicationTime":1669830010.000000000,"title":"ECB says bitcoin is on ‘road to irrelevance’ amid crypto collapse","id":"technology/2022/nov/30/ecb-says-bitcoin-is-on-road-to-irrelevance-amid-crypto-collapse"},{"body":"Bitcoin is less “digital gold” and more “digital beef”, according to a study that suggests the cryptocurrency has a climate impact greater than that of gold mining and on the level of natural gas extraction or rearing cattle for meat. The research from the University of New Mexico, published in the journal Scientific Reports, assessed the climate cost of various commodities as a portion of their overall market cap. Some, such as coal, cause almost as much damage as the entire value of the market they support, a 95% ratio, according to the analysis. Other commodities, such as pork production, generate huge climate impacts in absolute terms but only because the market is so massive. Bitcoin, however, lies in between the two. According to the economists, the climate damage of producing the digital currency has averaged 35% of its market value over the past five years, peaking at 82% in 2020. That is comparable to beef, which causes harm equal to 33% of its market, or natural gas, which hits 46%. And it is far in excess of gold, the commodity that the cryptocurrency’s backers most compare it to, which has a climate impact of just 4% of its market value, thanks to its enormous overall value dwarfing the large environmental impact of its extraction. The digital currency’s disproportionate harm to the climate comes from its reliance on a computing process to verify transactions called “proof-of-work mining”, which requires huge electricity expenditures to participate, rewarding those who carry it out with the chance to win some new bitcoin. On more than one day of 20 in the period the researchers examined, the climate damage from these “bitcoin miners” exceeded the value of the coins produced, overwhelmingly due to that electricity consumption. Some have argued that renewables could cover this demand but the authors wrote that the climate damage for each dollar of value created was 10 times worse for bitcoin than for wind and solar generation – representing “a set of red flags for any consideration as a sustainable sector”. This week a different study on the climate impacts of bitcoin found the proportion of fossil generation used to power proof of work was far higher than that claimed by advocates. Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index has long tracked the estimated power use of the bitcoin network, but an update launched this month adds a new dataset to the estimates: a “mining map”. This shows the geographical distribution of bitcoin miners. Combining that data with previous studies on regional differences in electricity generation, the researchers were able to estimate the proportion of generation which is renewable. “The results show that fossil fuels account for almost two-thirds of the total electricity mix (62.4%) and sustainable energy sources 37.6% (of which 26.3% are renewables and 11.3% nuclear),” wrote Cambridge’s Alexander Neumueller. “The findings thus noticeably deviate from industry findings that estimate the share of sustainable energy sources in bitcoin’s electricity mix to be 59.5%.” However, even though the generation mix is still carbon-intensive, the overall emissions of bitcoin have fallen in the past 12 months because of the sharp decline in the value of the cryptocurrency. Prices for bitcoin, and therefore the anticipated payouts to miners, have fallen by two-thirds, sending some out of business and leading others to cut their activities, in the process cutting emissions by about 14% compared with 2021, the researchers estimate. Those emissions are comparable to those of countries such as Nepal or Central African Republic, the Cambridge team says.","publicationTime":1664463623.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin climate impact greater than gold mining, study shows","id":"technology/2022/sep/29/bitcoin-climate-impact-gold-mining-environmental-damage-cryptocurrency"},{"body":"The price of bitcoin has fallen below $20,000 (£16,400) amid deepening turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. The cornerstone digital asset slipped to levels not seen since December 2020 on Saturday morning, at one point going under $19,000 before recovering to about $19,160, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin has now lost more than 70% of its value compared with the peak it reached last year. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been hit by several factors including rising inflation, which has prompted interest rate rises by central banks. This, in turn, has dampened investor appetite for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies and has hit global stock markets, with the previously high-flying tech sector affected in particular. Last week the UK and US central banks raised rates in an attempt to quell rising prices, putting further pressure on digital assets. Cryptocurrency is the term for a group of digital assets that share the same underlying structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. Crypto’s backers have said the sector represents a good investment because, for instance, it carries low fees and, unlike conventional currencies, is not tied to governments. However, its detractors say a lack of regulatory oversight or implicit government support, due to crypto and bitcoin’s independent origins, make it susceptible to scams and wild fluctuations in price. The crypto market, which trades on a 24-hour basis, is also suffering internal problems that began with the collapse of Terra, a so-called stablecoin whose value was supposed to be pegged to the dollar. Its failure in May shook faith in digital assets, triggering a wave of selling that has been exacerbated by the wider interest rate moves. The entire crypto market, worth more than $3tn in November last year, is now valued at $884bn, according to data firm CoinGecko. The investor panic also started to affect financial businesses focused on the crypto markets. Last week Celsius Network, a bank-like business that offered high rates of return on cryptocurrency deposits, stopped customer withdrawals. Then Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that made expensive bets on the crypto markets, admitted it was in trouble. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Three Arrows’ co-founder, Kyle Davies, said the firm was looking at asset sales or selling itself to another business. The $20,000 level is viewed as important by some crypto followers for a number of reasons. About half of all bitcoin wallets were sitting on profits at a price of just over $20,000 according to an analysis by the Columbia Business School in New York, cited by the New York Times. Last week, a crypto executive told Bloomberg that a fall below $20,000 might trigger more sell-offs because some financial firms have borrowed heavily to bet on a rising bitcoin price, but will have to liquidate their positions – in effect cutting their losses – if the currency falls below $20,000. “There are lot of funds, large borrowers of bitcoin, who have liquidation positions in $20,000 range,” said Bobby Lee, chief executive of the crypto storage company Ballet Global, in an interview with Bloomberg TV.","publicationTime":1655554359.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin value slumps below $20,000 in cryptocurrencies turmoil","id":"technology/2022/jun/18/bitcoin-value-falls-cryptocurrency-markets-turmoil"},{"body":"UK authorities should regulate cryptocurrency trading as a form of gambling rather than a financial service, parliament’s Treasury committee has said after a fresh inquiry into the industry. The government must avoid wasting more taxpayer funds promoting tech innovations such as digital tokens, without demonstrating the clear benefits to the public, MPs said in a report published on Wednesday. Like gambling, cryptocurrency trading and investing can be addictive, MPs concluded. And while the underlying blockchain technology could benefit the wider financial services industry, the process of betting on the volatile price of unbacked assets such as bitcoin could lead consumers to lose life-changing sums of cash. “Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK’s financial services industry,” the Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair, Harriett Baldwin, said. “However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such. “By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens’, consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.” The recommendations could influence government plans to regulate cryptocurrencies, which are being considered after a consultation earlier this year. It has been widely expected that cryptocurrency trading would eventually fall under the Financial Conduct Authority – which is currently responsible for ensuring firms comply with money-laundering rules, and will soon be tasked with monitoring adverts. However, the Treasury committee said treating cryptocurrency trading or investing like a financial service – and regulating it via the FCA – risked creating a “halo effect” that could lead consumers to believe the industry was “safer than it is” or that they were protected from financial losses, when they are not. The report said that regulating cryptocurrencies as gambling would be consistent with the government’s principle of “same risk, same regulatory outcome”. The report also hit out at the government’s recent attempt to produce a non-fungible token via the Royal Mint. NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, the same decentralised ledger of transactions used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. However, the project – which Labour had criticised as a “crypto gimmick” – was scrapped in March, just under a year after the project being announced. The Treasury committee said it was calling on the government to take a “balanced approach” to technology and “avoid expending public resources on supporting cryptoasset activities without a clear, beneficial use case”, adding that the failed NFT project was “a case in point”. It said: “It is not the government’s role to promote particular technological innovations for their own sake.” A Treasury spokesperson said the risks posed by cryptocurrencies were “typical” of those posed by financial services, “and it is financial services regulation – rather than gambling regulation – that has the track record in mitigating them”. The CryptoUK industry group did not respond to a request for comment before publication.","publicationTime":1684278074.000000000,"title":"Cryptocurrency trading in UK should be regulated as form of gambling, say MPs","id":"technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps"},{"body":"Crypto firms must warn customers they should not expect protection if their investment goes wrong and introduce a “cooling off” period for first-time investors, under new rules imposed by the UK financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority said that from 8 October firms promoting crypto products or services would need to carry a clear risk warning in their adverts. The FCA said an example of such a notification would include telling customers they should not expect protection “if something goes wrong” and ought to be “prepared to lose all the money you invest”. Customers should be urged to “take two mins to learn more”, the FCA added. Companies advertising crypto assets, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, will need to offer a pause to new investors requesting to invest in their products. Bonuses for introducing friends to a crypto firm’s products will also be prohibited. Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said consumers should understand that the crypto industry remains largely unregulated, with the lack of a safety net putting investors at risk of losing all their money. “It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice,” he said. “Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money.” The FCA said research showed that estimated crypto ownership in the UK more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. According to an FCA-commissioned survey, 10% of respondents said they owned crypto assets. The watchdog has also warned that cryptoasset fraud is on the rise, with reports of crypto scams climbing from 1,619 in 2019 to 6,372 in 2021. The FCA said some crypto promotions had already been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority including an advert by Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, that appeared on the London Underground and London bus networks that said: “If you’re seeing Bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy.” The ASA also ruled in 2021 that a Facebook advert for a fan token issued by Arsenal football club trivialised investing in crypto. The FCA said the new rules brought crypto in line with a regime introduced last year for misleading adverts related to high-risk investments. Further regulation is on the way for crypto firms in the UK. In February, the Treasury published a consultation document on bringing crypto regulation in line with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.","publicationTime":1686200402.000000000,"title":"Crypto ads will need to carry risk warnings under new UK rules","id":"technology/2023/jun/08/crypto-ads-risk-warnings-fca-uk-rules-october"},{"body":"The amount of electricity consumed by the largest cryptocurrency networks has decreased by up to 50% as the “crypto winter” continues to eat at the incomes of “miners” and financial contagion spreads further throughout the sector. The electricity consumption of the bitcoin network has fallen by a third from its high of 11 June, down to an annualised 131 terawatt-hours a year, according to estimates from the crypto analyst Digiconomist. That still equates to the annual consumption of Argentina, with a single conventional bitcoin transaction using the same amount of electricity that a typical US household would use over 50 days. The decrease in electricity used for Ethereum, the “programmable money” that underpins much of the recent explosion in crypto projects, has been sharper still, down from a peak of 94TWh a year to 46TWh a year – the annualised consumption of Qatar. The underlying reason for the fall is the same for both currencies, however. The electricity consumption of a cryptocurrency network comes from “mining”, which involves people using purpose-built computers to generate digital lottery tickets that can reward cryptocurrency payouts. The process underpins the security of the networks, but incentivises the network as a whole to waste extraordinary amounts of energy. As the price of cryptocurrencies has fallen – bitcoin peaked at $69,000 (£56,000) earlier this year, and is now hovering at about $20,000 – the value of the rewards to miners has dropped by the same proportion, leaving those in areas with expensive electricity or using older, inefficient mining “rigs” unable to turn a profit. “This is literally putting them out of business, starting with the ones that operate with suboptimal equipment or under suboptimal circumstances (eg inefficient cooling),” said Alex de Vries, the Dutch economist behind Digiconomist. “For bitcoin mining equipment that’s a big issue, because those machines cannot be repurposed to do something else. When they’re unprofitable they’re useless machines. You can keep them around hoping the price will recover or sell them for scrap.” Ethereum, by contrast, can be mined using a normal computer. But it is most profitable to do so using a very powerful graphics card, which has led to widespread supply shortages of the cards and turned many gamers against the industry. The collapse in mining revenue has led to a flood of graphics cards on the second-hand market, as insolvent miners try to recoup their investments, but De Vries warnsit is a lottery to buy one. “These machines are typically operating 24/7 and the components will get hot doing so. Heat [especially for prolonged periods of time] is known to wear out electronics, reducing longevity and reliability. “Right now it will mainly be older GPUs [graphics processing unit] becoming unprofitable, meaning that it’s not unlikely these devices have been used for mining for a long time.” Thankfully for gamers, the falling demand has also led to large price cuts for new components. Although the fall in bitcoin’s price has stabilised over the past week, the wider cryptocurrency sector continues to stumble as a result of the huge price collapse. The latest jolt was caused by the failure of the ersatz cryptobank Celsius, which announced on 12 June that it was halting withdrawals as it faced a liquidity crisis. The failure of Celsius triggered a domino effect across the wider sector: Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, experienced its own liquidity crunch as a result, and multiple companies with substantial outstanding loans to 3AC have now had to take emergency measures in turn. Two other companies that offered bank-like services announced large exposures to 3AC. Last week Finblox said the hedge fund’s actions had an “effect on liquidity”, and heavily restricted user withdrawals, dropping the daily limit from $50,000 to $500 while stopping interest payments on deposits. On Wednesday Voyager, which offers 12% on crypto deposits, revealed it had an outstanding loan of $650m to 3AC, more than four times its available cash. Voyager added that it would consider 3AC in default if the hedge fund did not repay the loan in full by Monday morning. The company has also reportedly frozen user withdrawals. Bancor, a decentralised finance protocol that acts as an exchange, lost out to “the recent insolvency of two large centralised entities”, believed to be Celsius and 3AC, and had to impose withdrawal limits. On Thursday another crypto exchange, CoinFLEX, announced that it was pausing withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions”. Amid the collapses, one large cryptocurrency company has emerged as a would-be saviour of the sector. Alameda Ventures, the investment arm of the crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, centred on his exchange FTX, has bailed out Voyager and the embattled exchange BlockFi, offering multimillion-dollar loans to both companies. The loans have earned him comparisons to JP Morgan, the US banker who stepped in during a 1907 financial crisis and bought up the stock of troubled companies in an effort to halt the collapse.","publicationTime":1656071369.000000000,"title":"Electricity used to mine bitcoin plummets as crypto crisis widens","id":"technology/2022/jun/24/electricity-consumption-mine-bitcoin-plummets-crypto-crisis-widens-cryptocurrency"},{"body":"For years Craig Wright has claimed that he is the mythical figure who created bitcoin. But a legal bid by the Australian computer scientist to defend his assertion that he is Satoshi Nakamoto resulted in a pyrrhic victory and a tarnished reputation on Monday. A high court judge in London ruled Wright had given “deliberately false evidence” in a libel case and awarded him £1 in damages after he sued a blogger for alleging that his claim to be the elusive Nakamoto was fraudulent. “Because he [Wright] advanced a deliberately false case and put forward deliberately false evidence until days before trial, he will recover only nominal damages,” wrote Justice Chamberlain. Wright had sued blogger Peter McCormack over a series of tweets in 2019, and a video discussion broadcast on YouTube, in which McCormack said Wright was a “fraud” and is not Satoshi. The issue of Nakamoto’s identity was not covered by the judge’s ruling because McCormack had earlier abandoned a defence of truth in his case. Wright claimed that his reputation within the cryptocurrency industry had been “seriously harmed” by McCormack’s claims. He said he had been invited to speak at numerous conferences after the successful submission of academic papers for blind peer review, but 10 invites had been withdrawn following McCormack’s tweets. This included alleged potential appearances at events in France, Vietnam, the US, Canada and Portugal. But McCormack submitted evidence from academics challenging Wright’s claims, which were then dropped from his case at the trial in May. Wright later accepted that some of his evidence was “wrong” but said that this was “inadvertent”, Chamberlain said in his judgment. The judge noted that there was “no documentary evidence” that Wright had a paper accepted at any of the conferences identified in the earlier version of his libel claim, nor that he received an invitation to speak at them except possibly at one, and that any invitation was withdrawn. Wright’s explanation for abandoning this part of his case because the alleged damage to his reputation from the “disinvitations” was outside England and Wales “does not withstand scrutiny”, the judge added. He concluded: “Dr Wright’s original case on serious harm, and the evidence supporting it, both of which were maintained until days before trial, were deliberately false.” Lawyers for McCormack had argued that his tweets were made in “flippant and lighthearted terms” and were in response to posts by Calvin Ayre, a Canadian businessman, “goading others into accusing Dr Wright of being a fraud”. They also claimed there were “numerous other individuals who had posted the same allegations about Wright”, Chamberlain explained in his ruling. Chamberlain concluded that although the tweets were “flippant in tone”, they came from “a well-known podcaster and acknowledged expert in cryptocurrency”. “They were unequivocal in their meaning. Many people who read them would have known that there was a lively debate about whether Dr Wright was Satoshi, but some of them must have been influenced by reading Mr McCormack’s trenchantly expressed contribution to that debate,” the judge continued. “The fact that he was willing to state his views so brazenly in response to threats of libel proceedings is likely to have made those who read them more, not less, likely to believe them.” But the judge said that Wright’s pre-trial case over the serious harm to his reputation made it “unconscionable” that he should receive “any more than nominal damages”. The judge asked for both sides’ legal teams to make submissions on the award of costs. Chamberlain found that McCormack’s comments in the video discussion, which included calling Wright a “liar” and a “moron” were defamatory, while the video and a majority of the tweets caused “serious harm” to Wright’s reputation. In statement Wright said: “I intend to appeal the adverse findings of the judgment in which my evidence was clearly misunderstood. I will continue legal challenges until these baseless and harmful attacks designed to belittle my reputation stop.”","publicationTime":1659377138.000000000,"title":"Craig Wright wins ‘only nominal damages’ of £1 in bitcoin libel case","id":"technology/2022/aug/01/craig-wright-wins-only-nominal-damages-of-1-in-bitcoin-libel-case"},{"body":"As bitcoin plunged below $20,000 in mid-June, many cryptocurrency users were distraught over massive losses – with some reporting they had lost their life savings. But one corner of the internet was cheering: Buttcoin, a Reddit subforum launched in 2011 to poke fun at cryptocurrency. “I’m addicted, I need help,” read one popular post. “I just love watching line go down too much. I always tell myself ‘after it breaks through this next support line, you’ll be satisfied’ but there’s ALWAYS another lower level after that.” “I’m actually hoping it levels off at 20K for tonight,” said another user. “I’m kinda tired and need more time to think of new lower priced memes.” One tech industry worker who frequents Buttcoin told the Guardian they stayed up until 3am one night to watch the crash unfold. “I know this may sound pathetic but I get a dopamine hit when I see the bitcoin price going down. It was so exciting.” The cryptocurrency flirted with its two-year low again this week, which meant a festive mood at Buttcoin. With about 135,000 members, the subreddit is tiny compared with the millions of people who chat on Reddit’s many pro-cryptocurrency forums. But frequent contributors to the community – whose logo replaces bitcoin’s golden “B” with a pair of golden buttcheeks – describe it as a kind of digital support group, laced through with dark humor, for people who are horrified by the proliferation of crypto scams and pyramid schemes. Though they may not have the power to destroy crypto, they can make jokes when it stumbles. As Buttcoin members say, instead of mining useless digital coins – they’re “mining comedy gold”. Just like the crypto culture it mocks, Buttcoin has its own set of memes. Some of them simply flip crypto sayings. Instead of baying for token prices to rise “to the moon”, Buttcoin users chant “to the floor”. But Buttcoin’s most popular jokes take pro-crypto logic and push them to sarcastic extremes. To skewer crypto promoters’ habit of spinning negative news, Buttcoin users comment “This is good for bitcoin” under stories of cryptocurrency catastrophes. (Bitcoin’s been banned in a major country? Good for bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price is plummeting? Good for bitcoin. Someone lost their life savings to a bitcoin scam? You guessed it… good for bitcoin.) Another crypto catchphrase smugly referencing the technology’s complexity, “Few understand,” has been become a Buttcoin meme in its own right. (For example: a Buttcoin user jokes that a 2003 Toyota Camry’s rising price amid the crypto crash makes the Camry a superior “store of value”. “Every 2003 Camry has a unique VIN and you can drive it to the supermarket too … Few understand,” another replies. “This is good for Toyota,” a third chimes in.) Buttcoin’s most senior moderator, an IT worker who goes by spookmann, told the Guardian that the 11-year-old forum has “changed as crypto itself as grown and festered. “Originally the tone was almost entirely ‘Haha... that’s so silly!’ And certainly that element is still present, but nowadays there’s an increasingly tragic element of ‘Ugghh... so many people are having their lives ruined by this damn thing!’” The biggest posts on Buttcoin are shot through with schadenfreude. The subreddit invariably celebrates when bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, dips below symbolic price levels – which to many Buttcoin users, proves that the scam is unraveling. “I definitely get hopeful when it starts seriously dipping or when some stablecoin scheme goes to zero,” said Joe, a systems engineer who browses Buttcoin every day. “There’s a kind of thrill to the validation of it, right? Especially since the crypto bro stereotypes are so obnoxious whenever it goes up in a new bubble.” But the more controversial posts mock crypto investors themselves for losing money – though there’s disagreement over how far to go. Some highly rated posts on the subreddit argue that there should be no sympathy for victims. “They can go fuck themselves,” read one post in late June, with more than 1,500 upvotes: “Criticizing scams is not being mean. This also isn’t a support group to help console people who lost all of their money on ElonDogPoop Coin.” Not all Buttcoin users agree. “Even if they are assholes, I don’t relish the idea of the average [investor] losing their life savings even if they should have been able to see the scam for what it is. That unambiguously sucks,” Joe says. There’s a “shared enjoyment of watching things go up in flames”, said M, a Buttcoin user and a tech industry worker, but he still has “sympathy for those drawn into crypto by family members or by the promise of a better life … Times are tough for most.” He pointed to the victims of Celsius, an unlicensed crypto “bank” that offered massive returns to over a million investors in an alleged ponzi scheme that collapsed earlier this summer. The court testimonies – which included pleas from ordinary people who lost their life savings – were “heartbreaking”, M said. Because Reddit’s pro-cryptocurrency forums quickly delete critical posts, Buttcoin also attracts users looking to commiserate over loved ones who have been caught up in the scam. One support seeker was Izzycc, a 23-year-old social work student whose boyfriend of eight years had become depressed after getting sucked into the NFT fad and losing money. “I’m absolutely fucking praying for the downfall of cryptocurrency,” she wrote. “It would mean a wakeup call for him, he might finally pull out of this scam, and maybe even start to feel a little better not staring at a number that’s only going down.” Buttcoin users urged Izzycc to break up with her boyfriend – and so she did. “It was for a couple of reasons, but the NFT stuff was kind of a big one,” she told the Guardian. “I just hated being around it all the time. I hated when he would talk to my family about it. It was just kind of embarrassing, I guess.” She’s doing “a lot better now”, but still browses Buttcoin: “The people are funny, and I know too much about cryptocurrency to not at least casually browse the site at this point.” Buttcoin sometimes deals with heavier tragedy. In August, a user described a close friend who had gone all-in on crypto before he killed himself. “I was secretly making fun of him,” the user wrote, “till I recently heard the bad news … and it’s hard to feel sorry for crypto bros, but now that I’m here, I do.” “I’m tearing up hearing about this,” wrote one user. Another user observed: “This sub makes a lot of jokes that I consider comic relief, but everything about this sucks, in reality.” That’s the tension that runs through Buttcoin: beneath the memes lies real pain – and a frustration of watching helplessly as more people around you get hurt. “I think if the crypto cult was just a bunch of dudes off in the woods with a server farm and a maypole there wouldn’t be any real call for Buttcoin to exist,” said Joe. “But it apparently intends to stick around and become a sufficiently big part of the world overall that I don’t have that option.” Buttcoin isn’t so much a force for resistance as it is a coping mechanism, Joe said, and one that at least for him, may even be backfiring. “I’m pretty sure the algorithms have actually been sending me more crypto ads since I started posting regularly because they can’t tell the difference between ‘I’m reading about how absurd this is’ and ‘I’m reading about this as a potential sucker/customer.’” He refreshes Buttcoin anyway, hoping he’ll one day witness the price go all the way to the floor.","publicationTime":1662699624.000000000,"title":"When bitcoin plunges, Buttcoin cheers: the online community praying for the end of crypto","id":"technology/2022/sep/09/bitcoin-buttcoin-online-community-praying-for-cryptos-death"},{"body":"The cryptocurrency market has endured another day of volatility as the Binance exchange temporarily suspended bitcoin withdrawals and the total value of the digital asset market dipped below $1tn (£820bn), after a cryptocurrency lender stopped customers from taking back their funds. The cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network halted withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions”, prompting a selloff. Bitcoin dropped to a 17-month low of $23,629 after the Celsius announcement, while ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, dropped more than 15% to $1,237, its lowest since January 2021. Meanwhile, Binance announced it had “temporarily paused” bitcoin withdrawals owing to a “stuck on-chain transaction”, before announcing a resumption several hours later. The total value of the cryptocurrency market fell below $1tn after the sell-off, according to the data site CoinMarketCap, which had valued the market at almost $3tn in November. Celsius said in a blogpost it was “pausing” all withdrawals and transfers between accounts for its 1.7 million customers. The company offers customers high interest rates – as much as 18% – on their cryptocurrency deposits and pays the interest in crypto assets, which includes its own token, called CEL. “Due to extreme market conditions, today we are announcing that Celsius is pausing all withdrawals, swap, and transfers between accounts,” the platform said. “We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations.” Binance said in a statement that bitcoin withdrawals had been suspended shortly after midday in the UK “due to an earlier batch of transactions getting stuck from low transaction fees submitted”. As a consequence there had been a backlog of bitcoin network withdrawals, Binance said. It then announced at 4.30pm BST that withdrawals had resumed. On 7 June, Celsius had published a blog seeking to reassure customers amid volatile conditions in the cryptocurrency markets, triggered initially by a collapse in the crypto project Terra. Headlined “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead”, the blog said the company had not had “any issues meeting withdrawal requests”. Celsius has offices in London, New York and Lithuania. Celsius’s website tells customers they can “borrow like a billionaire”. It has $11.8bn in assets, down from more than $24bn in December last year. In November, it said it had raised $750m from investors including Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, one of Canada’s largest pension funds. Like a bank, Celsius also has a retail loan operation, with customers able to borrow money, denominated in US dollars, from the service. Because of the impossibility of sending debt collectors after a crypto wallet, however, Celsius loans are “overcollateralised”: customers need to deposit bitcoin or ethereum worth at least twice the value of the money they are borrowing. That can be useful if, for instance, a bitcoin millionaire needs some hard cash to buy a house but does not want to liquidate their bitcoin holdings because they are gambling the coin will go up again. However, unlike a bank, Celsius’s loans charge a lower interest rate than it pays on deposits. The company makes up the difference through an opaque investment strategy that has in the past included investing $300m in bitcoin mining, offering more traditional loans to unnamed “institutional investors” at higher rates of interest, and taking large stakes in other cryptocurrency projects. Occasionally, that strategy has resulted in large losses: a hack of the decentralised investment platform BadgerDAO that wiped out that project was revealed to have cost Celsius $50m in bitcoin. The company also had a close relationship with the defunct stablecoin project Terra, at one point investing $500m of funds in the Anchor Protocol, Terra’s own saving and lending service. Celsius also offers customers higher returns if they accept their interest payments in the project’s own crypto token, CEL, which was trading at $7 last year and has fallen to less than $0.20. Cryptocurrencies have also been swept up in a market panic over rising inflation and higher interest rates, which has dulled the appetite for higher-risk assets. “As inflation proves to be an even trickier opponent to beat than expected, bitcoin and ether are continuing to get a severe bruising in the ring,” said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. “They are prime victims of the flight away from risky assets as investors fret about spiralling consumer prices around the world.”","publicationTime":1655138382.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin withdrawals temporarily suspended in volatile day for crypto market","id":"technology/2022/jun/13/crypto-lender-celsius-network-halts-withdrawals-extreme-market-conditions"},{"body":"Good morning. The UN’s refugee agency said it was expecting 270,000 refugees to cross into Chad and South Sudan as airstrikes and reports of renewed fighting around the capital have threatened a delicate three-day truce. The intense fighting between army units loyal to its military ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the Rapid Support Forces led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, has killed 459 civilians and left many short of supplies, medicine and cash.

Opening arguments in Trump’s civil assault trial Yesterday was the opening day of Donald Trump’s civil assault trial. The advice columnist E Jean Carroll has accused the former president of pinning her against the wall of a New York department store and sexually assaulting her nearly 30 years ago. In a Manhattan federal court, Carroll’s attorney, Shawn Crowley, said his client was “filled with fear and shame” that kept her silent for decades. “In her mind, for many years, she thought what happened to her was her fault,” Crowley told the jury. Trump’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, told the jury of three women and six men that Carroll filed the lawsuit for political ends, to sell a book and for public attention. Tacopina said the rape accusation was invented by Carroll and two other women who were expected to testify that she told them about the assault shortly afterwards. This case remains the only one to come to court among more than a dozen allegations of rape, groping and other sexual assaults against Trump. Inside the other lawsuit involving Fox News and Tucker Carlson In the aftermath of Tucker Carlson’s abrupt departure from Fox News – a move many US pundits linked to the huge settlement the rightwing channel had just reached with Dominion Voting Systems – another legal case involving Carlson, his show and Fox that is also now gaining attention. Abby Grossberg, Carlson’s former booker, was fired by Fox News shortly after she filed two lawsuits against the company in March claiming that Fox News, Fox Corp, and employees including Tucker Carlson fostered a workplace riven with abusive behaviors. Fox News has described Grossberg’s claims as “unmeritorious” and “riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees”.

Don’t miss this: Fear and frustration in Mexico Before 43 Ayotzinapa college students were abducted in September 2014 in one of the most horrific and high-profile human rights abuses in Mexico’s recent history, the military received nearly a dozen complaints about cartel activity in the region. Independent investigators have long alleged that the military had detailed knowledge of criminal activity and collusion between the cartel and police before the attack, as well as real-time knowledge of the situation as it unfolded, and emails and documents leaked last year by a hacker group calling itself Guacamaya support those allegations. “They monitored the narcos and organized crime,” said Carlos Beristain, a member of the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts, which has spent eight years investigating the students’ disappearance. On the night of the attack, however, “the decision was to do nothing”. … or this: the Cop City protests in Atlanta For almost two years, protesters in Atlanta have been fighting against the construction of Cop City, a $90m police and fire department training base planned in a forest. In January, police shot and killed activist Manuel Paez Terán, or Tortuguita, catapulting the fight over Cop City into global headlines. But while the protests continue, the project is making headway and a key stretch of public land nearby is no longer accessible to people seeking to defend the forest. For the first time in nearly two years of opposition, authorities have shut down the public park part of South River forest, allegedly for the public’s safety. Climate check: can bitcoin ever go green? Bitcoin is chiefly known as a wild investment vehicle that – along with many other cryptocurrencies – can seemingly make or lose fortunes overnight.

The outspoken libertarian tech investor described multibillionaire Buffett, the world’s richest investor, as the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” in a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday. Thiel’s address began with an analysis of the investment merits of cryptocurrencies but soon escalated into a tirade against the financial establishment, including “bankrupt” central banks and the “hate factory” of ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles. “It’s a movement, and it’s a political question, whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of a movement are going to succeed in stopping us,” he said, shortly before naming Buffett as “enemy number one”. In a speech that also cited JP Morgan’s chief executive Dimon and Larry Fink, the chair of investment group BlackRock, he said institutions run by a “finance gerontocracy” were hindering the cryptocurrency. Thiel said choosing not to invest in bitcoin was a “deeply political choice” and the financial establishment should be told “you have to get onboard on this”. Thiel added that the $830bn (£638bn) bitcoin market could rival the global equities market, worth more than $100tn. Comparing bitcoin with conventional capitalism, he said, to applause: “Woke companies are sort of quasi-controlled by the government in a way that bitcoin never will be.” Thiel, 54, is the most high profile Trump supporter in the tech industry, having donated millions of dollars to Trump’s 2016 campaign and served on the ex-president’s transition team. Casting the progress of bitcoin in political terms, Thiel rounded off his speech with a libertarian rallying cry depicting cryptocurrency’s progress as a battle between ESG and a “revolutionary youth movement”. “If we had to summarise this in one frame, it is … the finance gerontocracy that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signalling, hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would … think of as a revolutionary youth movement.” He added: “We have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.” Thiel announced in February that he was stepping down as a board director at Facebook’s parent, Meta. Thiel has been on the Meta board since 2005 and is a confidant of Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.","publicationTime":1649426985.000000000,"title":"Paypal founder launches tirade against ‘gerontocracy’ over bitcoin","id":"technology/2022/apr/08/peter-thiel-paypal-founder-tirade-gerontocracy-bitcoin"},{"body":"The epic collapse of wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32bn (£27bn) crypto empire, FTX, looks set to go down as one of the great financial debacles of all time. With a storyline full of celebrities, politicians, sex and drugs, the future looks bright for producers of feature films and documentaries. But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, rumours of the death of crypto itself have been much exaggerated. True, the loss of confidence in “exchanges” such as FTX – essentially crypto financial intermediaries – almost surely means a sustained steep drop in prices for the underlying assets. The vast majority of bitcoin transactions are done “off-chain” in exchanges, not in the bitcoin blockchain itself. These financial intermediaries are vastly more convenient, require much less sophistication to use and do not waste nearly as much energy. The emergence of exchanges was a major factor fuelling cryptocurrencies’ price growth and if regulators come down hard on them, the price of the underlying tokens will fall. Accordingly, bitcoin and ethereum prices have plummeted. But a price adjustment alone is not the end of the world. The pertinent question is whether crypto lobbyists will be able to contain the damage. Until now, their money has been speaking volumes; Bankman-Fried reportedly gave $40m to support the Democrats in the US, and his FTX colleague Ryan Salame reportedly gave $23m to Republicans. Such largesse surely helped persuade regulators around the world to follow a wait-and-see approach to crypto regulation, rather than be perceived to be stifling innovation. Well, they waited, and with the FTX crash, we must hope that they saw. But what will they conclude? The most likely path is to improve regulation of the centralised exchanges – the firms that help individuals store and trade cryptocurrencies “off chain”. The fact that a multibillion-dollar financial intermediary was not subject to normal record-keeping requirements is stupefying, no matter what one thinks about the future of crypto. Firms would face compliance costs, but effective regulation could restore confidence, benefiting firms aiming to operate honestly, which are surely the majority, at least if one weights these exchanges by size. Greater confidence in the remaining exchanges could even lead to higher crypto prices, though much would depend on the extent to which regulatory demands, particularly on individual identities, ultimately undermined demand. After all, the major transactions currently conducted with crypto may be remittances from rich countries to developing economies and emerging markets, and capital flight in the other direction. In both cases, the parties’ desire to avoid exchange controls and taxes implies a premium on anonymity. On the other hand, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the ethereum blockchain and one of the crypto industry’s most influential thinkers, has argued that the real lesson of FTX’s collapse is that crypto needs to return to its decentralised roots. Centralised exchanges such as FTX make holding and trading cryptocurrencies much more convenient, but at the expense of opening the door to managerial corruption, just as in any conventional financial firm. Decentralisation can mean greater vulnerability to attack, but so far the largest cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have proven resilient. The problem with having only decentralised exchanges is their inefficiency compared with, say, Visa and Mastercard, or normal bank transactions in advanced economies. Centralised exchanges such as FTX democratised the crypto domain, allowing ordinary people without technical skill to invest and conduct transactions. It is certainly possible that ways to duplicate the speed and cost advantages of centralised exchanges eventually will be found. But this seems unlikely in the foreseeable future, making it hard to see why anyone not engaged in tax and regulatory evasion (not to mention crime) would use crypto, a point I have long emphasised. Perhaps regulators should push toward decentralised equilibrium by requiring that exchanges know the identity of anyone with whom they transact, including on the blockchain. Although this may sound innocent, it would make it rather difficult to trade on the anonymous blockchain on behalf of an exchange’s customers. True, there are alternatives involving “chain analysis”, whereby transactions in and out of a bitcoin wallet (account) can be algorithmically examined, allowing the underlying identity to be revealed in some cases. But if this approach was always enough, and all semblance of anonymity could always be obliterated, it is hard to see how crypto could compete with more efficient financial intermediation options. Finally, rather than simply banning crypto intermediaries, many countries may ultimately try to ban all crypto transactions, as China and a handful of developing economies have already done. Making it illegal to transact in bitcoin, ethereum and most other crypto would not stop everyone, but it would certainly constrain the system. Just because China was among the first does not make the strategy wrong, especially if one suspects that the main transactions relate to tax evasion and crime, akin to large denomination paper currency notes such as the $100 bill. Eventually, many other countries are likely to follow China’s lead. But it is unlikely that the most important player, the US, with its weak and fragmented crypto regulation, will undertake a bold strategy any time soon. FTX may be the biggest scandal in crypto so far; sadly, it is unlikely to be the last. Kenneth Rogoff is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, said people would have been “very happy” four years ago had they been told that bitcoin would be trading at $20,000 in 2022. The cornerstone crypto asset fell below that level at the weekend in a symbolic move that represented a wipeout of gains for many long-term bitcoin holders. “I think given this price drop, from the all-time high of 68k to 20k now, it will probably take a while to get back. It probably will take a few months or a couple of years,” Zhao told the Guardian, adding that “no one can predict the future”. He added: “20k we think is very low today. But you know, in 2018, 2019, if you told people bitcoin will be 20k in 2022, they would be very happy. In 2018/19, bitcoin was $3,000, $6,000.” On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $20,491 according to CoinDesk, having hit levels not seen since late 2020 at the weekend. Asked whether he considered the current fluctuations in bitcoin and crypto prices to be “normal”, as he had described them in an interview earlier this month, he said: “If you look at the bottom [of bitcoin], right now it’s higher than the last peak. So, whether normal or not, I think with the industry still definitely growing, fluctuations in price is normal.” Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been affected by several factors including stock market declines linked to rising inflation and ensuing hikes in interest by central banks. Raising rates – a path taken by the US, UK and Swiss central banks last week – can make risky assets less attractive. For instance, certain tech stocks, whose price can be based on expectations of strong future earnings over many decades, can be relatively less appealing than the fixed returns on offer immediately from investments such as bonds, which become more attractive in a higher lending rate environment. However, the crypto market’s woes have also been linked to problems specific to digital assets. Last month, the failure of terra, a so-called stablecoin whose value was supposed to be pegged to the dollar, rattled faith in cryptocurrencies. It was followed last week by Celsius Network, a bank-like business that offered high rates of return on cryptocurrency deposits, stopping customer withdrawals. Then Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that made expensive bets on the crypto markets, admitted it was in trouble. Zhao declined to comment on a Bloomberg report that the US financial watchdog is investigating whether Binance broke securities rules when it launched an initial coin offering – a form of fundraising for companies – of its BNB token in 2017. “We talk with all regulators around the world. They send us questions, we answer them, with an investigation or not,” he said. Binance has been banned from undertaking any regulated activity in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority, which said in June last year the firm was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. Binance temporarily halted withdrawals last Monday because of what it called a “stuck on-chain transaction”. Asked if the withdrawal freeze was related to the wider crypto market problems, Zhao said: “I don’t think it’s a pure coincidence. In market turmoil, there’s more transactions on a blockchain and many of the blockchain nodes do fail.” Cryptocurrency is the term for a group of digital assets that share the same underlying structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. A node is a device within the blockchain network that validates transactions. Asked if the digital asset market was approaching another “crypto winter” – a phrase coined during a market dip in 2017/18 – Zhao said some projects could be in trouble because they were conceived when the market was at its most recent peak. The current value of the entire crypto market is just under $1tn, compared with around $3tn in November last year, with bitcoin hitting an all-time high of nearly $69,000 over the same period. “Right now, it definitely feels many projects are in a bind because once you get to an all-time high, all the projects spend money like they were always going to be at that all-time high. So now when it drops it feels like during the winter. But for projects that have conserved cash, we’re still fine, we’re still hiring, we’re still growing.”","publicationTime":1655964039.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin could stay below $69,000 peak for two years, says Binance boss","id":"technology/2022/jun/23/bitcoin-below-69000-dollar-peak-two-years-binance-boss"},{"body":"Following the bankruptcy of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled again. It is now about $16,500 – a far cry from the all-time high of $66,000 just a year ago. Why such a large drop in value? It’s because of the highly toxic combination of an exchange (an electronic platform for buying and selling) called Binance, a stablecoin (a crypto whose price is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar or another “fiat” currency) called tether, and the skilled professional traders running high-frequency algorithms. Unlike stocks, bitcoin can be traded on many different exchanges, but Binance has more than 50% of the entire crypto market, and as a result it sets the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In order to buy cryptocurrencies, traders must convert fiat money, into a stablecoin like tether. Bitcoin-tether has by far the largest volume of all products on Binance, and because one dollar usually equals one tether, trading on bitcoin-tether sets the dollar price of bitcoin. But when bitcoin crashes, so does the entire crypto ecosystem. The issue is that Binance is only self-regulated, meaning it is completely unregulated by traditional market regulators such as the Securities Exchange Commission in the US or the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. This is a great attraction for professional traders because they can deploy high-frequency price-manipulation algorithms on Binance, which are against the law in regulated markets. These algorithms can cause rapid price movements up and down, making bitcoin extremely volatile. Binance does its own clearing and settlements of trades, the same as all other self-regulated crypto exchanges. This means that losing counterparties – those on the other side of profitable trades – often have their positions wiped out automatically without notice. Unlike normal exchanges, self-regulated crypto exchanges aren’t required to raise the alarm when a trade has lost so much money that the collateral in the account needs topping up. Instead, traders are solely responsible for funding their accounts by continually monitoring something called the liquidation price. This is done automatically by the algorithms run by professional traders, but it is exhausting for ordinary players like you and me, who need to remain highly vigilant whenever manipulation is being used to create the volatility that professional traders use to increase their profits. When professionals trade against each other it is called toxic flow, because the chance of profit is more like 50-50 if their algorithms are equally fast and effective. Professional traders much prefer their counterparty to be an ordinary investor. This is worrying because Binance has been hugely successful at attracting ordinary investors. The fees it earns from this kind of investor have funded its very rapid expansion; it is now branching out with its own stablecoin, blockchain and NFT marketplace. Binance is consolidating its role as the Amazon of crypto, following a very effective business model. In some ways one can liken the current circumstances in crypto markets to the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2001-2. The venture capital that had poured into internet startups in 1999-2000 suddenly dried up, as many companies went bankrupt. This year, Three Arrows Capital, one of the largest crypto hedge funds, defaulted on its loans, and major crypto-lending companies Celsius and Voyager filed for bankruptcy as the price of bitcoin collapsed, following some unexpected and shocking attacks on a new type of stablecoin called Terra. Following the bankruptcy of FTX, several other exchanges such as Gemini, and lending platforms (shadow banks) including Genesis are preventing customers from withdrawing their funds. We shall see a lot more of this contagion, precipitating widespread bankruptcies among startups now that venture capital has dried up in the crypto sector. More exchanges and lending platforms, as well as blockchains, NFT marketplaces, data aggregators and analytics companies, will all bite the dust. Binance could emerge from this chaos with a monopoly. But right now, this non-domiciled and self-regulated company still needs fee revenue from ordinary investors, and it needs market makers (professional traders akin to unfriendly stall holders on the exchange) to conduct its business. The danger is that everyone is very scared now, so the only way to draw in ordinary investors is to pump up the price of bitcoin again. This would tempt people back into the crypto game, only to have their savings wiped out as the cycle of volatility continues. • Carol Alexander is professor of finance at the University of Sussex and a consultant in crypto markets and financial risk analysis","publicationTime":1669217402.000000000,"title":"After the FTX crash, here’s what you need to know – the crypto bubble is already bursting | Carol Alexander","id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/23/ftx-binance-crypto-market"},{"body":"For my sins, I have been reading Future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets, 82 pages of prime Whitehall verbiage that was published recently, setting out HM Treasury’s plans to govern the clouds and hold back the tides. It opens with the statutory ringing endorsement by Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury. He reminds readers that the government’s “firm ambition is for the UK to be home to the most open, well-regulated and technologically advanced capital markets in the world” – which “means taking proactive steps to harness the opportunities of new financial technologies”. He further believes that “crypto technologies” can have a profound impact across financial services and that “by capitalising on the potential benefits offered by crypto we can strengthen our position as a world leader in fintech, unlock growth and boost innovation”. Cont’d p94, as they say in Private Eye. Billed as a “consultation and call for evidence”, the document invites our views on these important matters. As a public-spirited columnist, it would be churlish to refuse the invitation. So here goes. First, though, a general observation about the tone of the document, which sometimes reads as though it had been written by crypto enthusiasts trying to sound grown up. Thus the talk everywhere is of “benefits” (actual or potential) and of “opportunities” flowing from crypto technology. Nowhere, though, are these supposed upsides explicitly itemised. And while there are many references to “risks”, they are always seen in the context of downsides than can – and will – be “managed”. Since it seems improbable that the massed bands of philosophy, politics and economics alumni in the Treasury would be so crass as to engage in such boosterism, I started digging to find its source. It is to be found in annex B of an earlier Treasury document, the “final report” of the Cryptoassets Taskforce. The authors of that report had “benefited from the contributions of stakeholders across the DLT [distributed ledger technology] and cryptoasset sector” – namely, more than “60 firms and other stakeholders”. Which, being translated, means 60 vested interests. At the heart of the consultation document are two hard problems. The first is what to do about the trade in cryptoassets. The other is what to do about the DLT (AKA blockchain) technology that underpins much crypto activity. So what’s a cryptoasset? The Treasury defines it as “a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights that uses some type of DLT and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically”. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are examples. So are NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The Treasury estimates that there are at least 2,000 of these in existence and trading in them has become a kind of wild west inhabited by libertarian nutters, scammers, tech enthusiasts and get-rich-quick operators who gather in packs to separate suckers from their life savings. The only way to impose regulatory order on this free-for-all is to regulate the exchanges that enable the trading of crypto tokens and their conversion to fiat currency (that is, real money). The problem for HM Treasury is that it can only regulate exchanges that are based in its jurisdiction and most of them will, such as the spectacularly insolvent FTX, be based elsewhere. The second problem facing would-be regulators of the crypto sector – what to do about DLT – seems, in principle, easier to solve. The technology enables the sharing and updating of records in a distributed and decentralised way. Participants can securely propose, validate and record updates to a synchronised ledger (a form of database) that is distributed across the participants. A blockchain is a particular kind of distributed ledger in which cryptography is used to identify and authenticate approved participants, confirm data records and facilitate consensus about whether a particular entry in the ledger is valid. Basically, there are two kinds of blockchain – permissionless and permissioned. The one underpinning bitcoin is the former kind: anyone can participate in consensus-formation, provided they have the computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles. They are built this way as a means of realising the libertarian dream of not having to trust any worldly institution to validate transactions. But that also implies that they are unregulated by design. And, of course, they heat the planet. Permissioned blockchains, in contrast, restrict access to the ledger to known parties (banks, for example) who can update it. They are computationally more efficient and, in a way, are just a different kind of database. As such, they are relatively easy to regulate. Two conclusions to the questions posed by the consultation paper emerge from this. The first is that regulation of trade in cryptoassets can only be done by regulating the exchanges in which they are bought and sold. The UK will have jurisdiction only over those exchanges that are based here. Ultimately, regulation will therefore be done by regions over which even HM Treasury has no control. This may be unpalatable to devout believers in British exceptionalism, “global Britain” and so on, but it’s the reality. The second lesson is that permissionless blockchains can never be allowed within the financial services sector. And that’s fine because permissioned ones will do the job more efficiently and within the rule of law.

So far this year, the most poplar crypto currency has gained almost 40%, but had slipped back in the last few days as traders grew more uncertain about monetary policy. Wael Makarem, Senior Market Strategist – MENA at Exness, explains: Bitcoin was able to recover strongly since the beginning of the year as sentiment among investors improved globally, inflation retreated and fears of an economic slowdown subdued. However, the crypto market remains well below its historical highs and could strongly benefit from a looser monetary policy. Over the longer term, interest rates could stabilize this year and could start declining towards the end of the year if the Federal Reserve’s inflation targets are met in the meantime. As a result, while a tighter monetary policy could negatively affect digital assets over the short term, it could pave the way for a more significant recovery within the year. The dollar has now climbed to a one-month high against a basket of currencies: Stocks have inched lower at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 92 points, or 0.27%, to 33,799 points, as anxiety over interest rates lingers. The S&amp;P 500 index is down 0.15%. But shares in US retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond tumbled around 48% at the open, a day after proposing a $1.025bn financing to save it from bankruptcy. The eleventh-hour deal that will be used to restructure the company’s debt load outside of court. The company had been preparing for a Chapter 11 filing after lenders declared it in default last month. Rishi Sunak’s first cabinet reshuffle since becoming PM in October has implications for the business world and the UK economy. The BEIS department is being broken up, with the creation of a new Department for Energy Security &amp; Net Zero to be run by Grant Shapps, and a combined Department for Business and Trade this morning, with Kemi Badenoch as its secretary of state. Sunak is also creating a dedicated Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and refocusing the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to “recognise the importance of these industries to our economy”. Stephen Phipson, CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation says these departments ned to collaborate to develop an industrial strategy. “Business now needs a period of stability and for the four new departments to work together to create a powerful industrial and energy strategy which delivers a long-term and consistent plan to boost growth and help Britain’s world class manufacturers compete more effectively on the global stage. “The continued emphasis on science and innovation demonstrates the Government’s commitment to ensuring the UK remains a science super-power but it is critical that we continue the scale up of innovation within Britain’s businesses to boost growth and tackle the UK’s longstanding issues with under investment and productivity. Now the new Secretaries of State must work urgently with business to develop a consistent industrial strategy to ensure buy in from all Government departments and one which is understood to be a priority at national and regional level.” The UK property sector, meanwhile, is getting another new housing minister, as incumbent Lucy Frazer has been promoted to Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in the reshuffle. Speaking of savings…NS&amp;I has launched a new issue of its Green Savings Bonds, paying an annual rate of 4.20% over a three-year term. Money invested in the bonds will help to finance projects as part of the UK Government’s Green Financing Framework. Projects will include making transport greener, using renewable energy over fossil fuels, preventing pollution, using energy more efficiently, protecting natural resources and adapting to a changing climate. Savers will need to be prepared to lock their money away for three years, as funds cannot be withdrawn during this time. There is a a cooling-off period in the first 30 days of investment. The minimum investment in Green Savings Bonds is £100, with a maximum limit of £100,000 per person for each Issue. MPs on the Treasury committee also challenged the bank bosses over complaints from constituents that they are too tardy in passing interest rate increases onto savers. Labour MP Angela Eagle accused banks of being “ungenerous” on the rates that they offer on instant saver accounts, as the FT report here. Tory MP and former minister Andrea Leadsom asked lenders whether they relied on the “inertia” of customers and questioned why they did not inform customers on better offers at competitors. Lenders pointed to products which they said were highly competitive, and spoke about trying to help customers to move into regular saving. As Dame Alison Rose, Natwest’s chief executive, put it: “Our digital regular saver which is paying 5 per cent is encouraging people to build that savings habit.” Barclays UK CEO Matt Hammerstein told MPs that its Rainy Day saver account paid 5%, and suggested that some customers have lost the habit of saving, due to interest rates being so low for so long. Britian’s banking bosses have insisted they remain committed to physical branches, after a string of recent closure announcements which have been criticised by consumer groups and unions. During today’s Treasury Committee hearing, Ian Stuart, chief executive of HSBC UK, said the bank is “absolutely committed to a physical footprint in the UK”. He told MPs: “We think it’s important, but we have to get it scaled properly for the long term. “Customer behaviours started to change in 1982 with the advent of the cash machine. And it’s been on a journey from that point and it’s speeded up. “And through the pandemic it accelerated, there’s no question that customers changed their banking behaviours.” HSBC announced in November it planned to close more than one in four bank branches in the UK. Dame Alison Rose, chief executive of NatWest Group, said the bank was seeing significant shifts in customer behaviour. “But we recognise we need to look after all of our customers and make sure that we support particularly vulnerable customers.” NatWest announced it was shutting another 23 branches in England and Wales in January. Charlie Nunn, CEO of Lloyds Banking Group [which announced 40 branch closures last month] told MPs: “We remain very committed to our branch network.” In December, research from KPMG found that cost of living pressures have increased the number of customers relying on bank branches to help manage their squeezed budgets. You can’t patent the sun, as polio vaccine developer Jonas Salk pointed out in 1955. But in the supermarket sector, Tesco and Lidl have begun a High Court fight over a yellow circle logo. The dispute centres on Tesco’s use of a yellow circular loyalty programme logo which Lidl alleges infringes its trade marks for the circular Lidl logo. PA Media has the details: German discount chain Lidl says a trademark, and copyright, has been infringed, while Tesco has made a counterclaim. Lidl uses a yellow circle in its main logo, and Tesco uses one to highlight offers available to members of its Clubcard scheme. A judge began overseeing a trial at the High Court in London on Tuesday. Mrs Justice Joanna Smith was shown images of logos, including a yellow circle, surrounded by a red ring, containing the word “Lidl”; a yellow circle, surrounded by a red ring, with no words; and a yellow circle without a red surround and the words “Clubcard Prices” in the middle. Over in Beijing, president Xi Jinping has pledged that China will work to achieve economic improvement. Reuters has the details: China will strive to achieve overall improvement in economic operations, further guide business entities to strengthen confidence and stabilize expectations, state radio cited President Xi Jinping as saying on Tuesday. The world’s second-largest economy grew 3% in 2022 from a year earlier, badly missing the official target of around 5.5% and hitting one of its worst rates in nearly half a century. More from the Treasury committee hearing: There are ‘huge public interest questions’ over the UK’s plan to create a digital pound, says Barclays UK CEO Matt Hammerstein. Asked by the Treasury committee about the plan (announced overnight) to roll out a digital currency by the end of the decade, Hammerstein tells MPs that it could lead to a two-tier system. Hammerstein told MPs: Introducing a digital currency that is led by a central bank on behalf of a government runs a risk of creating a two-tier payment system between those who are enabled to be on that digital currency and those who are still wed to cash. The whols issue of access to cash needs to be resolved, Hammerstein says. He also suggests there is the risk of ‘public hoarding’ of digital cash, which could lead to runs on financial institutions. On the upside, a digital pound could help to simplify and modernise the plumbing of the payments system to simplify and modernise, but that will take time and is risky, Hammerstein suggests. In the foreign exchange markets, the pound has dropped below $1.20 for the first time in a month. Sterling has sagged to $1.1983 against the dollar, and is also slightly lower against the euro at €1.1194. The US dollar’s sharp recovery has not shown any major signs of a reversal yet, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, after last Friday’s jump in US employment. Razaqzada explains that January’s strong employment growth could encourage the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to keep interest rates high for longer. Investors are now expecting the Fed to maintain a contractionary monetary policy in place longer than expected in order to dampen inflationary pressures that could arise from a tighter labour market. This is why we have seen the probability of another 25-basis point rate hike in March rise to almost 100%, while that of another 25 bp hike in May has jumped to 67% from about 40% a week ago. In contrast, the Bank of England is only expected to make one more quarter-point rate rise, and could reverse that by the end of the year. Alison Rose, the head of NatWest bank, says her bank is preventing customers from investing in crypto assets, as part of a crackdown on fraud. Rose told the Treasury committee that NatWest has “quite strict rules” restricting its customers investing in crypto, and has blocked a number of platforms and exchanges where customers suffered fraud. “We look at it through a fraud perspective,” Rose told MPs. “We are restricting people investing in crypto because we are concerned.” She says this policy can frustrate customers who want to invest their own money in crypto. But, Rose explains: “We have taken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto, and we’re blocking retail and wealth customers from transfering into crypto assets because of [concerns over] the volatility and the stability of the platform.” She reveals that 60% of NatWest customers who fell victim to frauds and scams in the last quarter of 2022 saw them on social media platforms and technology platforms, so the bank is doing its best to combat this “crime against customers” (fraud generally, not just crypto). Lloyds Banking Group believes that one in ten of its customers face a jump in mortgage costs this year, as they come off existing fixed rate deals. Charlie Nunn, Lloyds CEO, has told MPs on the Treasury committee that the last year has been very difficult for a number of its customers. One group Lloyds is concerned about, Nunn explains, is the 10% of customers who will see increased mortgage costs this year as their current fixed-rate mortgage deals end. About 1% of that group face an increase in interest payments to above 40% of their income, Nunn explains, adding the Lloyds has been ‘laser-focused’ on supporting this group, providing tools and ways to restructuring their debts. He also says that around 1% of Lloyds customers really can’t make ends meet on a daily basis. The bank, he says, is reaching out to this group, providing tools, support, and advice from debt charities. Nunn is appearing alongside Matt Hammerstein, CEO of Barclays UK; Ian Stuart, CEO of HSBC UK; and Dame Alison Rose, CEO of NatWest Group. This is the best remunerated panel to appear before the Treasury committee for some time, remarks chair Harriet Baldwin MP, with the quarter earning over £10m a year between them, the committee’s researchers estimate. Hammerstein tells MPs that everyone in the UK is facing a period of ‘dynamic adjustment’, due to the increase in interest rates from ultra-low levels. We’ve got a generation of people that haven’t seen [high] interest rates… even at 4%, [Bank of England] base rate still isn’t at its historic average. Adjusting from where we were to where we are is causing challenges to people across the spectrum. HSBC has cut the rate on one of its five-year UK fixed-rate mortgages to below 4%, as the market continues to calm down following turmoil in the autumn. HSBC UK has reduced a five-year fixed-rate mortgage deal for borrowers with a 40% deposit to 3.99%. The deal has a £999 fee. It is the first time since September 2022 that a five-year fixed-rate mortgage has been offered by HSBC at a rate below 4%, PA Media reports, adding: It is only available to homeowners who are remortgaging or those who are switching rates (existing customers rolling off an old deal and on to a new one with HSBC). The move is part of a wider range of mortgage rate cuts made by HSBC UK on Tuesday. The average interest rate on five-year, and two-year, fixed-rate mortgages surged over 6% last autumn after the mini-budget caused chaos in the bond market, driving up the yield on UK gilts. Rates have been dropping since, as the financial markets cut their forecasts for how high UK interest rates will peak. Common Wealth, the think tank, have calculated that BP spent 14 times as much on shareholder payouts over the last year as on capital expenditure on its ‘low carbon’ segment. Mathew Lawrence, director at Common Wealth, says this – and the plan to invest more in oil and gas - shows the need to reorganise the energy system: “The pivot back toward oil and gas - and the prioritisation of shareholders over renewable investment - confirms a critical lesson: the for-profit corporation is poorly equipped to deliver the energy transition at the required speed. Its incentives and purpose dangerously misalign with the needs of people and planet. A successful transition will require reckoning with that fact and acting to reorganise our energy system.” Today’s results show that BP spent $1.024bn on capital expenditure on low carbon energy (compared to $3.2bn on gas). In contrast, BP shareholders recieved annual dividends worth $4.3bn during the year, and also BP announced over $11bn of share buybacks (a way of returning cash to shareholders). BP (+3.5%) is pushing the FTSE 100 back towards the record highs set last Friday. The blue-chip share index has gained 35 points this morning, or 0.45%, to 7871 points. It hit a new alltime high of 7906.58 on Friday afternoon. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: “BP may be enemy number one in the public’s eyes for its record profits, but its latest success has helped to drive up the FTSE 100, which in turn will benefit people up and down the country with exposure to UK stocks in their pension,” says “The UK blue chip index advanced 0.5% to 7,873 with energy companies the key driver, alongside a good showing from banks and pharmaceuticals. This follows losses on Wall Street last night, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 1% and the broader S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.6%. Mould explains how the prospect of further interest rate increases are moving the markets, following stronger than expected jobs numbers last Friday in the US. A strengthening labour market theoretically makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will halt interest rate rises anytime soon. The Fed needs to see both the jobs market and inflation start to cool before it can justify changing its stance on rates. “Over the past month or so, investors have become more optimistic that we’re near the top of the rate rise cycle, hence why you’ve seen higher-risk companies do well on the stock market. If this optimism turns out to be misplaced then we’ll likely see investors flock back to sectors where you can typically find value stocks such as banking, energy and tobacco. In a way, today’s movement on the FTSE 100 already reflects this investor thinking.” The stabilisation in UK house prices in January may be just a ‘blip’, suggests Mike Scott, chief analyst at estate agency Yopa. Prices may fall again over the next few months. he suggests, although Yopa does expect that house prices will return to growth later this year, though not at the kind of rapid growth rates that we saw from 2020 to 2022. Scott adds: Despite last week’s base rate rise to 4%, mortgage interest rates are now falling as market expectations for further base rate rises are easing off. In addition, average earnings increases may be running behind overall inflation, but they are now well ahead of house price growth, and there is still a serious shortage of homes. All of these factors will drive renewed house price growth once the shock of last autumn’s abrupt interest rises is behind us. One in five households with prepayment meters have not cashed in their energy vouchers issued to help pay bills. About one in five people did not redeem the £66 energy support voucher they were sent by PayPoint in November, the company has said this morning. PayPoint had sent out hundreds of thousands of vouchers in November under a Government support scheme. But only 81% of those vouchers had been redeemed on Sunday when they ran out – 90 days after they were issued. It means that thousands of households with prepayment meters have missed out on energy bill support that they were entitled to. Back in December, charities and MPs called on ministers to intervene after it emerged that around 1.3m vouchers for homes with prepayment meters had been either lost, delayed or unclaimed. Fears of a German recession are swirling again this morning after factory production in Europe’s largest economy fell by more than expected. German industrial production dropped by 3.1% in December, new data this morning shows, and was 3.9% lower than a year ago. Production at energy-intensive industries fell by 6.1% during December, month-on-month, as soaring gas and electricity prices continued to hit manufacturers. This “terrible industrial production report” confirms that Germany’s economy’s came to a “sudden and hard halt in December”, says Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING. Brzeski warns: The former growth engine of the German economy is stuttering and no improvement is in sight. Despite the recent return of optimism as illustrated by improving sentiment indicators, the sharp drop in new orders, the inventory build-up in recent months and the lagged impact of high energy prices all still bode ill for the short-term outlook. Today’s industrial production was the last hard data for the month of December. It is a month to forget. Retail sales, exports and imports all fell sharply. Either this data will be strongly revised upwards in the coming months or the German economy entered hibernation in December. Despite the latest optimism reflected in improving sentiment indicators, this economic hibernation is unlikely to end any time soon. Danny Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policy maker, has predicted that “collapsing” house prices will push the UK central bank into a rapid pivot toward interest rate cuts. Blanchflower, who is now a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, told Bloomberg Radio that economic data will deteriorate as the sharp increase in interest rates hit activity. Blanchflower predicted: “We are seeing house prices tumbling. You’re going to start to see really bad stuff appearing as these economies slow fast and the central bank and the markets are then going to respond to that. Blanchflower, who served on the Bank’s monetary policy committee between 2006 and 2009 (during the financial crisis), says policymakers should have cut rates last week, rather than raising them to 4%. He explains: As I sat at the Bank of England, my job was to think about what inflation was going to be at about 18 months to two years down the road. And you change rates now because it takes time to have an effect. “What people should see is a collapsing housing market, a slowing economy and the reason is that these interest rate hikes that have been going crazily haven’t actually impacted the economy yet.” More here: Blanchflower Says Housing Market Collapse Will Force BOE Pivot Shares in BP have jumped to their highest level in over two months, after it reported profits doubled last year and lifted its dividend by 10%. BP shares are up 4.1% at 498p, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares. The company said this morning it hopes to “materially increase earnings through 2030”, and is aiming for profits of $51-56bn on an EBITDA basis in 2030. BP also said it plans to invest up to $8bn more in renewable energy systems, such as bioenergy and electric car charging networks. But it will also spend an extra $8bn in oil and gas by 2030, despite pressure from environmental campaigners to shift away from fossil fuels faster. CEO Bernard Looney says We need continuing near-term investment into today’s energy system - which depends on oil and gas - to meet today’s demands and to make sure the transition is an orderly one. We have high-quality options throughout our portfolio, allowing us to choose only the best. We will prioritise projects where we can deliver quickly, at low cost, using our existing infrastructure, allowing us to minimise additional emissions and maximise both value and our contribution to energy security and affordability.” The UK housing market is grinding to a halt and prices could soon be lower than a year ago, predicts Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Annual house price growth has slowed right down and is now just 1.9% - the consensus of data from around the market seems to suggest we will soon be seeing annual price falls. It’s been a turbulent time for the property market with soaring inflation putting pressure on our finances while the turmoil caused by the mini-Budget sent buyers running for the hills. It looks like the pain may not be over yet, because the RICS survey results show demand continues to fall, while Bank of England figures reveal mortgage demand has dropped as low as when the market was effectively closed at the start of the pandemic. We are starting to see mortgage rates come down, but it may not be enough to tempt many would-be buyers into the market just yet. January’s house price ‘stability’ could prove only a temporary interruption in advance of a further fall in prices, suggests Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Beck points out that Nationwide reported last week that house prices fell again in January, for the fifth month running, rather than stalling as Halifax reported this morning. Mortgage rates are much higher than a year ago, at a time when inflation is squeezing household budgets, Beck says: January’s flatlining in values may prove only a temporary interruption to a trend of falling prices. Although mortgage rates have dipped from post-mini-Budget peaks, they’re still at their highest in a decade. The average interest rate on a new mortgage ended 2022 at 3.68% – up from 1.59% 12 months earlier. Rates on larger mortgages have seen much bigger increases. For example, the average quoted rate for a two-year fix at 90% loan-to-value was 5.96% in December, 400bps higher than at the start of the year. Meanwhile, households’ ability to service debts is being squeezed by falling real incomes, and widespread predictions of a decline in property values are expected to encourage some potential buyers to wait before purchasing, weighing on demand and potentially making expectations of price falls self-fulfilling. Ed Miliband MP, Labour’s Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero Secretary, says it is ‘outrageous’ that the UK hasn’t brought in a tougher windfall tax on energy companies. Responding to BP reporting profits of $28bn (£23.2bn) for last year, Miliband says: “It’s yet another day of enormous profits at an energy giant, the windfalls of war, coming directly out of the pockets of the British people. “What is so outrageous is that as fossil fuel companies rake in these enormous sums, Rishi Sunak still refuses to bring in a proper windfall tax that would make them pay their fair share. “This is why people are sick and tired of the way the country is run under the Tories. In just eight weeks’ time, the Government plans to allow the energy price cap to rise to £3,000. Labour would use a proper windfall tax to stop prices going up in April. The currrent ‘energy profits levy’, announced last year, allows energy firms to use new investment in the North Sea to offset their windfall tax bill. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak insists it should be beefed up. Nowak says: “As millions struggle to heat their homes and put food on the table, BP are laughing all the way to the bank. “Hard-pressed families will rightly feel furious – they are being treated like cash machines. “This boils down to political choices. “Ministers are letting big oil and gas companies pocket billions in excess profits. But they are refusing to give nurses, teachers and other key workers a decent pay rise. “We need a government on the side of working people - not fat cat energy producers. “That means imposing a higher windfall tax on the likes of BP and Shell. It means giving public servants fair pay. And it means giving households extra financial support as bills rise this April.” Back in November 2021, before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, BP’s boss Bernard Looney notoriously described the energy giant as a ‘cash machine’. Nick Dearden, director at Global Justice Now, says BP’s earnings underline the need for a polluters tax. “It should sicken people to their core that BP is responsible for more global historic emissions than most countries on earth, yet has no plans to stop polluting even in the face of a global climate crisis. With a newly established Loss and Damage fund, it’s high time governments mandated fossil fuel companies to start paying up for their role in the climate crisis, starting with these enormous profits announced today. What’s even worse is that more than half of this ($14.7bn), made from the destruction of our planet, is leaving the pockets of struggling families and heading straight to super-rich shareholders, when millions of people can’t even afford to heat their homes. Enough is enough. It’s time to bring in a polluters tax and hold BP truly accountable for the destruction they’ve wreaked across the planet.” The key to selling a house in the current market is “getting the pricing right”, says Nathan Emerson, CEO of Estate Agent Body Propertymark. Those priced accordingly have sold quickly but those who are testing the market at higher prices, trying to align with last year are finding they have to reduce or be open to offers. The rise in interest rates will undoubtedly be affecting buyers overall budgets and sellers need to be realistic. This doesn’t look set to change any time soon as it’s likely the Bank of England will raise rates again in order to bring inflation under control.” The slowdown in annual house price growth to a three-year low of 1.9% in January shows the impact of higher borrowing costs on the UK housing market. And there could be further pressure on the housing market, with the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates above their current level of 4% this spring. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: Property transactions and mortgage demand have been slowing, weighed down by the Bank of England’s ten consecutive rate rises as the central bank looks to curtail borrowing in an attempt to stem stubbornly higher double-digit inflation levels in the UK. Potential buyers have been holding off with the hope that the housing market will cool further this year and mortgage rates will ease off. Just this week Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann indicated the central bank is likely to raise rates again, which will add to the cost of borrowing for mortgage holders, particularly for those on variable rates. However, looking further ahead, the central bank could pause on interest rates or even cut rates later this year, which could help support the housing market, particularly if the economic downturn reveals itself to be less aggressive than previously feared. Oil giant BP has doubled its profits last year, as the surge in energy prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine boosted its earnings. BP has reported underlying profits of $27.5bn for 2022 this morning, up from $12.8bn in 2021. Such bumper profits will surely lead to fresh calls for more stringent windfall taxes on the energy giants. BP has also lifted its dividend by 10%, and announced a new $2.75bn share buyback programme this morning. In the last quarter of 2022, BP’s fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, came in at $4.8bn – up from $4bn a year earlier, but down on the $8.2bn made in the third quarter of 2022. The average UK house price is now around £12,500 (-4.2%) below its peak in August last year, Halifax’s data shows. That’s still around £5,000 higher than in January 2022, when the average property cost £276,483. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK house prices stabilised in January, new figures from building society Halifax show, after falling in the final months of 2022. Halifax’s latest healthcheck on the housing market, just released, shows that the typical UK property cost £281,684 in January, little changed on December’s £281,713. That follows a 1.3% fall in December, and a 2.4% drop in November, as rising mortgage costs and the cost of living squeeze hit borrowers. The annual rate of house price growth slowed to +1.9%, from +2.1% in December, with the market cooling across the UK. That’s the slowest rate of annual growth in three years. The rise in mortgage rates last autumn and winter hit demand for mortgages, Bank of England data last month has showed. The start of 2023 has brought some stability to UK house prices, says Kim Kinnaird, Director of Halifax Mortgages. Kinnaird warns that rising borrowing costs could hit demand this year. “We expected that the squeeze on household incomes from the rising cost of living and higher interest rates would lead to a slower housing market, particularly compared to the rapid growth of recent years. As we move through 2023, that trend is likely to continue as higher borrowing costs lead to reduced demand. For those looking to get on or up the housing ladder, confidence may improve beyond the near-term. Lower house prices and the potential for interest rates to peak below the level being anticipated last year should lead to an improvement in home buying affordability over time. Also coming up today UK retailers suffered a disappointing January, new spending figures show, as consumers kept a tight rein on spending after Christmas. Total UK retail sales increased by 4.2% in January – less than half the 11.9% rise seen a year earlier and below the three-month average growth of 5.2%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)-KPMG retail sales monitor. That rise in sales actually shows a significant drop in volumes, given inflation has been at double-digit levels in recent months. Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive at British Retail Consortium (BRC), says consumer confidence remains “stubbornly low” as consumers brace for bills to rise this spring. She explained: “With ongoing cost pressures and labour shortages increases in sales don’t convert into increases in profits or cash.” The UK Treasury and Bank of England are designing a “digital pound” as an alternative to cash, and it could be here by the end of the decade The government is speeding up its response to the rise of privately issued cryptocurrencies and stable coins with a four-month public consultation process – they insist the digital pound would be as safe as cash.

Global stock markets have racked up fresh losses today, as a slowdown in China’s export growth fuelled concerns over the global economy. With inflation pressures high, investors continued to worry that central banks will push economies into recession by hiking interest rates to slow inflation. In London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped to a seven-week low, down 120 points, or 1.6% at 7264 points, with mining stocks among the fallers. European stocks also hit two-month lows, as a slowdown in China’s export growth worried the markets. And in New York, stocks have extend their recent selloff, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index falling another 2.5%, and the S&amp;P 500 hitting its lowest point for the year. Commodity prices have also dropped, with copper hitting its lowest since December, while the risk-off mood pushed bitcoin to its lowest since July 2021. The US dollar continued its rally, hitting a new 20-year high. Morale in the eurozone dropped, pushing the Sentix index of investor confidence fell to a near two-year low in May, the third monthly drop in a row. Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner warned that the global economy is facing a “perfect storm”, while signs of a eurozone recession were rising. And in the UK, Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders warned that inflation spike even higher than feared. In other news.... Morrisons is poised to beat the owners of Asda in the race to buy McColl’s, the struggling convenience store chain that is expected to be put into administration as soon as Monday morning. Barclays has avoided nearly £2bn in tax via a lucrative arrangement in Luxembourg that allowed it to pay less than 1% on profits in the tax haven for more than a decade. EasyJet is planning to remove seats in some of its planes this summer as part of a strategy to cut the number of staff it needs, as the airline industry struggles Half of older women fear they will have to keep working beyond the state pension age in order to make ends meet, according to research. The boss of one of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers has warned Rishi Sunak that the government must announce further help for families soon, to avoid an autumn emergency as the cost of living crisis deepens. The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products. The US also hit Moscow with new sanctions, targeting services, Russia’s propaganda machine and its defence industry. And we’ve been inside one of the UK’s first licenced medical cannabis labs, where medicinal marijuana is being produced to help people with chronic pain treatments. Goodnight. GW Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is worried that inflation could be even higher than the Bank’s latest forecasts. Last week, the Bank predicted the inflation could hit 10% before the end of the year, the highest level since 1982, as it lifted interest rates by a quarter-point to 1%. But in a speech this afternoon, Saunders warned that the cost of living squeeze on British households from high inflation could be bigger and last for longer than expected. That’s why he was one of three policymakers to vote for a half-point rise, he explains. Here are the key points from Saunders’ speech, at a Resolution Foundation event. Inflation, and key measures of longer-term inflation expectations, are uncomfortably high. Alongside large gains in prices of energy and consumer goods, domestic inflation pressures have been rising in recent quarters, evident in trends in capacity strains, longer-term inflation expectations, underlying pay growth and services inflation. The strength of external costs is eroding real incomes and is likely to cap real spending. But, by creating a long period of above-target inflation, these external cost increases also may exacerbate the rise in inflation expectations and hence, with the tight labour market, could make it harder to ensure domestic inflation pressures return to a target-consistent pace. Against this backdrop, the MPC has recently raised rates by nearly 100bp. At our most recent policy meeting, most MPC members (including myself) judged that, based on our updated assessment of the economic outlook, some degree of further tightening in monetary policy may still be appropriate in the coming months. I put considerable weight on risks that, unless checked by monetary policy, domestic capacity and inflation pressures would probably be greater and more persistent than the central forecast in the recent Monetary Policy Report. As a result, my preference has been to move relatively quickly to a more neutral monetary policy stance. Wall Street has joined the selloff, with the S&amp;P 500 index opening 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 2%. Here’s Robin Brooks, chief economist at the IIF, on the rising recession risks: Over in Mexico, inflation has hit a 21-year high. Consumer prices climbed by 7.68% in the year to April, the fastest since 2001, amid the global cost of living squeeze. China’s covid-19 lockdowns, rising inflation and the war in Ukraine are all driving recession fears, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. Two of the biggest concerns are supply chains and the impact of inflation including higher interest rates. As a result of severe Covid lockdowns, China’s export growth is at a two-year low. Year-on-year export figures slowed to 3.9%, while imports remained on par. The supply chain disruptions will in turn impact earnings of companies around the world, and thereby their stocks. Rising inflation is also leading to sharply higher interest rates and higher bond yields and this is undermining asset prices leading to falls in stocks, bonds and alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. With consumer inflation at an all-time high, along with rising energy prices, the cost of living crisis threatens to spill over into a larger recession in Europe and the US.” Worries about higher interest rates are also hitting stocks, according to Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at bond giant PIMCO. Ivascyn warned (via Reuters) that central banks such as the US Federal Reserve are determined to bring down inflation by tightening policy. “We see recession risk over the next 12 to 18 months to be as high as about 30%. “One of the key reasons for that is the Fed and other central banks appear dead set on getting inflation under control.” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says worries about Russia are also pushing markets down: “The continuing impact of Beijing’s zero-Covid policy in China and concerns about the Fed’s next moves are helping to pile the pressure on markets. “The impact of Chinese restrictions was reflected in export growth hitting two-year lows in April – in effect back where we were near the start of the pandemic. “And investors are getting an unnerving reminder of the current geopolitical risks as Russian President Vladimir Putin leads anniversary celebrations in Moscow to mark the Soviet victory against the Nazis in the Second World War. “This show of strength, as Russia displays its military arsenal, belies the weakness of the country’s position; isolated and stuck in a grinding conflict in Ukraine. However, it certainly sharpens focus on the wider threat the nuclear power can still pose. Airline passengers are continuing to suffer disruption today. Travellers at Manchester and Birmingham Airport have both reporting huge queues due to delays at security, leading some to miss their flights, as airports struggle to cope with increased demand. One passenger, Bob Black, tweeted that there were thousands queuing to get through security at Birmingham: At Manchester Airport, traveller Ryan Hoey reported that the security queue stretched outside the Terminal building there too. Airports have blamed several factors, including the time it takes for new ground staff to pass security clearance, staff sickness, a lack of Border Force officials and the spike in demand for travel following the end of the UK’s coronavirus restrictions. After a volatile morning, European stock markets are all deep in the red. The Stoxx 600 is down around 2%, with losses in London (where the FTSE 100 is down 1.8%), Frankfurt (-1.85%) and Paris (-2.2%). Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM says: The shellacking in equity markets shows no signs of abating, with the combined forces of rising interest rates, slowing global growth, and a furious race to cut leverage wreaking havoc on Wall Street. The tech-loaded Nasdaq lost 1.4% on Friday and futures point to another round of pain when the market reopens today. China remains committed to its zero-covid strategy despite growing signs that the economy is starting to crack. Authorities in Shanghai tightened lockdown rules again over the weekend, fueling worries around slower domestic growth and persistent global inflation as supply chains remain under strain. Bitcoin has now hit its lowest level since July 2021, as traders ditch riskier assets. Bitcoin has extended its earlier losses to hit the $32,700 mark for the first time in nearly 10 months. Darshan Bathija, chief executive of Singapore-based crypto exchange Vauld, said (via Bloomberg): “In light of fears of rising inflation, most investors have taken a risk-off approach -- selling stocks and cryptos alike in order to cut down risk.” The oil price has dropped too, on concerns that demand will be hit by China’s lockdowns. Brent crude has fallen 2% to $110 per barrel, as economic worries trump the G7’s pledge to phase out imports of Russian oil. Cryptocurrencies are also being hit by the selloff. Bitcoin has dropped by 8% today to its lowest level since late January, at around $33,300 -- around half its value six months ago. Saxo’s Strategy Team say: The week is off to a rocky start as risk aversion continues to hang over global markets after a rally attempt Friday in the US barely managed to avoid new lows for the cycle in the S&amp;P 500. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index did slip to new lows, however, and is well into bear market territory, down some 25% from the top last November. US dollar strength continues to suggest general liquidity conditions are poor, and risk-sensitive Bitcoin trades near the lows for the year. The selloff is gathering more pace, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.4% at a new seven-week low of 7282 points, down 105 points this session. Mining companies are still among the fallers, such as Glencore (-5.5%) and Rio Tinto (-4.3%) with growth worries also hitting packaging firm DS Smith, and chemicals group Croda. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says a ‘bearish sentiment’ is hitting stocks, with China’s export slowdown (see opening post) adding to the anxiety. Asian markets were softer overnight on some weak Chinese data and the broad failure last week to survive the Fed’s rate hike. China export growth slowed to 3.9% in April from a year earlier, compared with the 14.7% a year before. Lockdowns and the bottleneck at ports means this is probably going to worsen, too. Chinese PPI inflation data this week should be watched closely as a leading indicator for global consumer inflation. EasyJet plans to remove seats in some of its planes this summer as part of a strategy to cut the number of staff it needs. Employers across the economy have complained of difficulty recruiting staff at the salaries they are willing to pay, and airlines are struggling to meet the increased demand as international travel restarts in earnest after Covid-19 lockdowns. Airlines are required by law to provide one member of cabin crew for every 50 seats. By removing the final row of six seats on its smallest plane, the A319, easyJet will cut the number of passengers it can carry from 156 to 150, therefore limiting its requirement to three rather than four cabin crew. Emerging market stocks have dropped to their lowest in 22 months, hit by the strong dollar and fears of a global slowdown. China’s yuan has dropped to a near 19-month low against the US dollar today. April’s slowdown in export growth has reinforced concerns that China’s Covid-19 lockdowns across the country are taking a toll on economy. Kit Juckes of Société Générale says the markets have woken up with quite the hangover: Chinese trade data saw softness in both imports and exports, which isn’t very surprising under the circumstances but didn’t help risk sentiment at the start of the week. Nor did further Covid restrictions. The yuan and equity indices fell, and as US Treasury yields continue to edge higher, the bears took charge. Back in the markets, the US dollar has hit a 20-year high against rival currencies. China’s Covid lockdowns, accelerating global inflation and the worsening economic outlook have all boosted demand for the US currency as a haven, as Bloomberg explains here. Higher interest rate rises are also lifting the dollar, with the Federal Reserve committed to a series of half-point rates hikes in coming months (on top of last Wednesday’s 50bp hike). Investor morale in the euro zone has tumbled to its lowest level since June 2020 as the Ukraine war pushes Europe towards a recession. The Sentix index of investor confidence fell to a near two-year low in May, the third monthly drop in a row, The index dropped to -22.6 in May from -18.0 in April, weaker than expected. Investors were gloomier about the current economic situation, and the economic outlook. Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner warned that: The global economy is facing a “perfect storm”. The report warns that “The recession is becoming visible” in the euro area, as the Ukraine conflict and the sanctions on Russia hit the economy. Huebner explains: The sanctions against Russia are having an effect, on enemies and friends alike. Last month, the “first mover” economic index clearly pointed the way towards recession. At the beginning of May, the downturn deepened further. Europe is hit particularly hard. The overall Eurozone index drops to -22.6 points. And for Germany we report an alltime low in economic expectations. In other words: it’s coming thick and fast. Morrisons has reportedly beaten the owners of Asda in the race to buy McColl’s, the struggling convenience store chain that is expected to be put into administration as soon as Monday morning. The bid from Morrisons is due to be announced as the preferred bidder for McColl’s, despite an improved offer from EG Group, owned by the Issa Brothers, according to Sky News. McColl’s is to be sold via a pre-pack administration, after the Scotland-based retailer’s lenders declined a request to restructure its debt. That sparked a bid battle for the London-listed company, which employs 16,000 people across 1,100 shops in the UK. Morrisons, Britain’s fourth biggest grocer, already has a supply agreement with McColl’s, to which it provides a range of products under the Safeway brand. Morrisons was bought out by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice last year. Sky News are reporting that Morrisons has won the battle to seize control of convenience store chain McColl’s, beating petrol forecourts operator EG Group. Morrisons tabled a last-gasp counterbid for McColl’s Retail Group over the weekend. McColl’s announced on Friday that it would call in administrators after rescue talks failed, putting the future of its 1,100 shops and 16,000 staff into doubt. PA Media has more details: Forecourt giant EG - whose owners also run supermarket giant Asda - had been favourites to complete a rescue deal for McColl’s. However, it is understood that both EG and Morrisons both tabled late improved offers prior to the administrators’ Sunday 6pm deadline for offers. It is understood that EG has bowed to pressure to look after McColl’s pension liabilities, in a move that means that its 2,000 members will avoid a cut of up to 20% to their promised pensions over their lifetimes. Trustees for the McColl’s pension schemes have called on the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to do whatever he can to ensure pension scheme members are well protected. Morrisons’ early approaches had reportedly been rejected by lenders who preferred EG’s offer to instantly repay more than 160 million in debts from McColl’s. It is believed that Morrisons has now said it will also repay the lenders in cash. UK stock have fallen further into the red, as anxiety over the economic outlook rise. The FTSE 100 has touched its lowest level since mid-March, down 55 points or 0.75% at 7,333 points. Technology investor Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust is the top faller, down 4.5%, as US tech stock continue to be hammered by the prospect of higher interest rates. Property website Rightmove are down 4% after announcing its chief executive officer, Peter Brooks-Johnson, is stepping down. Mining stocks are under pressures, with China’s export slowdown threatening demand for commodities. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: All the major European bourses are under pressure with the FTSE 100 trading below 7,400, driven by weakness in the miners with stocks like Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Fresnillo trading at the bottom of the basket following China’s softer trade data. China’s trade sector accounts for around a third of GDP with the slowdown in exports pointing to a deceleration of international demand with sharp declines from the EU and US as inflation and the cost-of-living take their toll. Meanwhile domestically, China is dealing with the fallout from lockdowns, with factory activity and supply chains under pressure as Beijing pursues its draconian zero covid tolerance mission at the expense of its own economy. Metal prices have dropped, as the drop in China’s export growth raised worries about future demand. Reuters has the details: Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 1.8% at $9,250 a tonne, its lowest since December 15. LME aluminium slipped 1.3% to $2,804 a tonne, its lowest since January 4. The most-active June copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange ended daytime trading down 1% at 71,440 yuan ($10,633.17), after dropping to its lowest since March 16. Wall Street is on track for fresh losses, with the S&amp;P 500 index down 1% in the futures market: European countries should consider seizing Russia’s frozen foreign exchange reserves to help fund the cost of rebuilding Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat has suggested. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, told the Financial Times that it would be logical to use Russia’s reserves, $300bn of which were frozen after the Ukraine war began. Borrell pointed out that the US had taken control of billions of dollars’ worth of assets belonging to the Afghan central bank for humanitarian aid, and to compensate victims of terrorism - so the same principle could apply with Ukraine. Borrell told the FT: “I would be very much in favour because it is full of logic. “We have the money in our pockets, and someone has to explain to me why it is good for the Afghan money and not good for the Russian money.” But as the FT points out, the idea of seizing Russian foreign exchange reserves would be a dramatic move that would probably alarm other governments with fraught relations with the EU and its partners. Here’s the full story: The UK government expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine, my colleague Joanna Partridge explains. The new package of restrictions includes £1.4bn of UK import tariffs – border taxes paid by buyers on goods shipped from Russia – that will affect imports of platinum, palladium and other products including chemicals from Russia. The international trade department said Russia was highly dependent on the UK for exports of the precious metals, which will be subject to additional 35 percentage point tariffs. The government will also ban the export of more than £250m of goods in sectors where the Russian economy is most dependent on UK products, including key materials like chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. More here. The pound has hit a new two-year low against the US dollar. Sterling has dropped another half a cent to $1.226, the weakest since June 2020, extending its recent slide against the strengthening dollar. The pound tumbled last Thursday when the Bank of England predicted the economy would stagnate for two years as the cost of living crisis hit growth. As John Hardy of Saxo Bank explained last week: The UK is in the vanguard of economies that are beset with stagflationary risks, having been impacted on the supply side by the spike in energy prices that began even before the war in Ukraine and due to many Brexit-linked labour supply shortages. The Bank of England said that the UK population is suffering the second largest drop in living standards since 1964. European markets have also opened in the red, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 0.5%, adding to last Friday’s drop. The UK’s FTSE 100 slipped at the open, down 0.2%, as China’s lockdowns (and the impact on trade) add to investors’ concerns about a recession. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “The week has got off to a negative start for the UK’s market, a result of poor sentiment coming from the US and China. In the US, the trend has been negative for weeks, but had started to look brighter, before comments from the Bank of England at the end of last week about weak economic growth applied the brakes to momentum. Anxiety is stemming from the Fed’s next moves, with uncertainty creeping in about the scale and speed of interest rate hikes. All this comes at the same time as China grapples with ongoing lockdowns and the prevailing economic storm these entail. We saw Chinese export growth slow to two-year lows in April. That said, there have been tentative hints that China is stepping away from its blanket zero-Covid policy, which may mean an easing of the very tough conditions in the all-important production lines in the country. Shares have dropped in most Asia-Pacific markets after China’s export growth hit its lowest since June 2020, early in the lockdown. Japan’s Nikkei led the selloff, falling 2.5%, while China’s CSI 300 has dropped almost 1%, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 is down 1.2%, and Souh Korea’s KOSPI is down 1%. Investors are worried that central bankers will keep raising interest rates to cool inflation even as the world economy slows. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: Given the unsettled backdrop of the Ukraine War and China’s economic woes, it is challenging for the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates without dropping the US economy into a sinkhole Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Recession worries are swirling again this morning as China’s Covid-19 lockdowns, the Ukraine war, and the cost of living crisis all threaten the global recovery. China’s exports growth has tumbled to a two-year low, as the curbs introduced to battle Covid has hit factory production, disrupted supply chains and weakened domestic demand too. Exports slowed to 3.9% year-on-year in April, the weakest since June 2020. Imports growth was flat (and imports from the US dropped by 1.2%), as cities such as Shanghai were shut down to fight virus outbreaks. April’s data shows the impact of China’s latest Covid restrictions, including the tight lockdown in Shanghai which have lasted six weeks, disrupting the operations of companies including Tesla and Apple. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, says weakening foreign demand hit China’s exports, suggesting rising prices are now hitting consumer spending, “The sharpest falls were in shipments to the EU and U.S., where high inflation is weighing on real household incomes. The declines were also especially pronounced in electronics exports which suggest a further unwinding of pandemic-linked demand for Chinese goods.” Russia continues to be slammed with fresh sanctions over the war in Ukraine, which is now in its 75th day. Overnight, the UK has announced £1.7bn of fresh sanctions on Russia and Balarus, including hiking tariffs on its lucrative platinum and palladium imports. Last night, the G7 group of advanced economies pledged to phase out or ban the import of Russian oil, in a “timely and orderly fashion” (so no fixed date yet). The G7 added: “We will work together and with our partners to ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies and affordable prices for consumers.” Also coming up today The future of UK convenience store chain McColl could be decided today, as administrators weigh up rival bids from Morrisons and EG Group. Sky News reported yesterday that Morrisons had lodged an improved offer with McColl’s lenders, which said on Friday it would call in administrators, putting 16,000 jobs at risk.

The group said the move violates the state’s landmark climate law that was passed in 2019 and the lawsuit is the first to test how energy-intensive crypto mining legally holds up against the state’s climate goals. In September, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC), which oversees and regulates public utilities, greenlit the takeover of the Fortistar power plant in North Tonawanda, a town close to Niagara Falls, by Canadian crypto mining company, Digihost. The Clean Air Coalition of Western New York and the Sierra Club, represented by the non-profit Earthjustice, argued in their filing to the supreme court of Albany county that the PSC’s approval of the transfer violated the state’s sweeping climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), that was passed in 2019. The act set ambitious targets for the state, including having 70% of the state’s electricity generated by renewable energy by 2030, zero-emissions electricity by 2040 and an 85% reduction in statewide emissions by 2050. In their lawsuit, Clean Air and the Sierra Club said that the Fortistar plant was used as a “peaker” plant that would run 10 to 74 days a year, only when there was high demand for electricity, like in cold winters and hot summers. As a crypto mining plant, the facility would be running 24/7, producing up to 3,000% more greenhouse emissions, according to the court filings. The groups argue the CLCPA broadly requires the state to conduct environmental reviews when making approvals and decisions, to ensure the state will ultimately meet its climate goals. The PSC “refused to consider the CLCPA and its requirements” when undergoing the approval process, which started in April 2021, according to the court filing. Along with increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue that several communities around the Fortistar plant have been designated as possible “disadvantaged communities” under the state’s climate law, meaning those living in the area bear greater environmental burdens and have experienced historical disinvestment. The law “requires all state agencies – including the [commission] – to consider greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to disadvantaged communities when considering administrative approvals and decisions,” said the court filing. “If such an action would threaten the CLCPA’s greenhouse gas reduction mandates, it cannot proceed without a justification.” In response to environmental concerns that were brought to the PSC by Clear Air and the Sierra Club during the approval process, Digihost said it would convert the facility to renewable natural gas, with the ultimate goal of using all hydrogen by the end of 2023, according to public filings. The company also told the commission that its mining facility was approved by the North Tonawanda planning commission, which conducted its own environmental review. Mining crypto, like Bitcoin, is very energy intensive. If Bitcoin mining were its own country, it would rank 36th in annual electricity consumption, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which tracks electricity consumption used to mine Bitcoin. After China – once the center of crypto mining – banned it in 2021, the US became the largest hub for mining. Companies flocked to states with cheap electricity and large power plants, including New York, Texas and Kentucky. While other states have been more welcoming to the crypto mining industry, state officials in New York have recently blocked the growth of mining, citing the state’s climate change goals. In June, Greenidge Generation, a mining company that took over a power plant upstate, was denied the renewal of a key air permit by the state’s department of environmental conservation, which cited the CLCPA as the impetus for its decision. Greenidge is currently fighting its permit denial and is still in operation. In November, Governor Kathy Hochul passed a two-year moratorium on new crypto mining operations using fossil fuels in the state. Digihost’s takeover of the plant precedes the bill being signed into law, making it exempt from the moratorium. Hochul, when signing the bill, said it is “a key step for New York as we work to address the global climate crisis”. Advocates for crypto mining say miners help bring jobs and economic activity to rural areas, though critics say the amount of job creation is negligible. Mining advocates also argue that crypto mining has been unfairly singled out in the state for its electricity usage and miners are likely to head to states that are more friendly to the industry. “To date, no other industry in the state has been sidelined like this for its energy usage. This is a dangerous precedent to set in determining who may or may not use power,” the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an advocacy group, said in a statement upon the moratorium’s passage. The lawsuit also comes at a tumultuous time for the crypto industry after the collapse of FTX, once one of the largest crypto exchanges, in the fall. Following the company’s demise, the price of Bitcoin fell below $16,000, leaving many miners with plummeting assets.","publicationTime":1673629838.000000000,"title":"Environmental group sues New York for approving crypto mining facility","id":"us-news/2023/jan/13/environmental-group-sues-new-york-crypto-mining"},{"body":"As crypto-Twitter cascaded with apocalyptic memes about the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the sharp drop in the bitcoin price, one account has remained notably silent on the topic. Unlike in previous crashes, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, who made bitcoin legal tender a year ago, did not exhort his followers to “buy the dip”. The laser eyes, popular among crypto currency traders, have long since been removed from his Twitter profile. On the day that FTX declared insolvency, he announced that the country would sign a free trade agreement with China. His vice-president, Félix Ulloa, said that China had offered to buy the country’s $21bn in foreign debt as part of the deal. The Central American country of 6.5 million finds itself in a tough financial position. In January it must pay €667m ($688m)for a Eurobond amortization. At the beginning of the year Bukele promised that his country would issue bitcoin-denominated bonds to pay off national debt and forecast that the price of bitcoin would reach $100,000. But the so-called “volcano bonds” never emerged and today the bitcoin price hovers around $16,000. The best tracker of the president’s opaque trading estimate that he has spent over $107m on 2,381 bitcoin. Today that investment is worth a little over $40m. “If Bukele dreamed that he could create a different and innovative political economy, against the advice of the IMF, that dream has failed,” said Luis Membraño, a Salvadoran economist. “There are no easy alternatives, no short-cuts.” The bitcoin losses are relatively insignificant to the overall debt, but the president’s determination to mock advice from the IMF to backtrack on his bitcoin policy has spooked international markets. When the ratings agency Moody’s announced a January downgrade in the country’s credit, Bukele tweeted: “Breaking: El Salvador DGAF”, an acronym of “don’t give a fuck”. Now Fitch says that some form of default is likely in January. With inflation rising, a recession looming and the fiscal situation worsening, El Salvador cannot turn on the printing press because the country adopted the US dollar as national currency in 2001. Instead the government has dipped into its reserves to cover its fiscal hole. If the situation deteriorates, the country could eventually be forced to move off the dollar, according to Membreño. However, to accept debt financing from China would signify a definitive break from the US and move the country closer China, Russia and Turkey, according to Membreño. “It would represent a total realignment of El Salvadoran foreign policy,” he said. That financing wouldn’t come cheap, according to Evan Ellis, a senior associate at the Washington DC based Centre for Strategic &amp; International Studies. “China acts as a payday lender, they make good money off of these deals,” he said. “But they often find a way to tie the loans to long-term commercial and strategic benefits opening the way for Chinese companies.” Since El Salvador ended its relationship with Taiwan in 2018, China has agreed to build a stadium and a library in the country but its plans to convert the port of La Unión into a logistics hub have stalled. Closer ties to China could also suit Bukele’s own ambition. He has attracted criticism from the US and Europe for seeking re-election in 2024 in contravention of the country’s constitution. “When populist governments, of the left or right, come to power, China acts as a non-judgmental underwriter,” said Ellis. “China can give Bukele financial independence to be authoritarian and ride roughshod over the constitution.” With an approval rating around 90%, Bukele remains the most popular president in Latin America, based on a heavy-handed approach to law and order and regular attacks on the old political elite. When Salvadorans elected him in 2019, following decades of corruption from the traditional parties and spiraling gang crime, many felt they were in the last-chance saloon. But as a bitcoin gambler, Bukele has known neither when to hold them nor when to fold them. Closer ties to China would represent yet another roll of the dice.","publicationTime":1668508220.000000000,"title":"China circles El Salvador’s economy as country edges toward crypto plunge","id":"technology/2022/nov/15/china-el-salvador-economy-cryptocurrency-fall"},{"body":"The cryptocurrency-focused US lender Silvergate is to wind down its operations after it was hit by customer withdrawals following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The California-based bank had warned last week it was “less than well capitalised” after depositors demanding their money back, adding that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern. Silvergate said a voluntary liquidation of the bank was “the best path forward” in light of “recent industry and regulatory developments”. The failure of FTX sparked renewed volatility in the crypto markets. Silvergate also revealed it was being investigated by the US Department of Justice. Its wind-down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of deposits, the bank added. Silvergate reported a $1bn (£840m) loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 after investors raced to withdraw more than $8bn in deposits, forcing it to incur losses as it sold assets to cover the cost of the withdrawals. Multiple partners of the bank, including Coinbase, a crypto exchange, and Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services company, cut their links with Silvergate last week. FTX and its affiliated trading arm, Alameda Research, had Silvergate accounts. After Silvergate’s statement, Coinbase said it had no client or corporate cash at the lender. Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, said his company did not have any asset losses at Silvergate. Founded in 1988, Silvergate ventured into crypto in 2013. The bank had also operated a mortgage warehouse business, but announced in December it would be winding down that division, citing the rising interest rate environment and reduction in mortgage volumes. Last week, the bank discontinued the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), its crypto payments platform and one of its most popular offerings. That network enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle. While risks of contagion are minimal, given that Silvergate has said it will repay depositors and has performing loans, the loss of SEN is disappointing, said Ram Ahluwalia, the chief executive of Lumida Wealth, an investment adviser that specialises in digital assets. “It’s more of a strategic loss of critical infrastructure for crypto,” he told Reuters. Federal prosecutors in Washington are investigating the company and its dealings with FTX and Alameda Research. In January, three US senators asked Silvergate for details about its risk management and FTX. More than $1tn was wiped off the value of the crypto sector in 2022, as rising interest rates affected appetite for riskier assets. After rapid growth in 2020 and 2021, bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency by far, fell more than 60% last year, pressuring the digital assets industry. Bitcoin fell below $16,000 after FTX’s collapse in November, but has since recovered to about $21,000.","publicationTime":1678373115.000000000,"title":"Crypto bank Silvergate announces liquidation amid sector turmoil","id":"technology/2023/mar/09/crypto-bank-silvergate-liquidation-sector-turmoil-wind-down-ftx-exchange"},{"body":"A computer engineer who accidentally threw away a hard drive containing approximately £150m worth of bitcoin plans to use artificial intelligence to search through thousands of tonnes of landfill. James Howells discarded the hardware from an old laptop containing 8,000 bitcoins in 2013 during an office clearout and now believes it is sitting in a rubbish dump in Newport, south Wales. The council has previously denied the 37-year-old’s repeated requests to search the site due to environmental concerns but he has hatched a £10m hi-tech scheme backed by hedge fund money to find the digital assets. His new proposal would utilise AI technology to operate a mechanical arm that would filter the rubbish, before then being picked by hand at a pop-up facility near the landfill site. Under the plans he will hire a number of environmental and data recovery experts, and while the search is ongoing employ robot dogs as security so no one else can try to steal the elusive hard drive. Howells said: “Digging up a landfill is a huge operation in itself. The funding has been secured. We’ve brought on an AI specialist. Their technology can easily be retrained to search for a hard drive. “We’ve also got an environmental team on board. We’ve basically got a well-rounded team of various experts, with various expertise, which, when we all come together, are capable of completing this task to a very high standard.” Howells believes the search will take about nine to 12 months, however, even if he does get permission from the council, there is no guarantee the hunt will be successful or that the bitcoins he mined all those years ago will be recoverable from the hard drive. But if they are he has pledged to use the money to help the community of Newport and invest in a number of cryptocurrency-based projects, such as a community-owned data mining facility. Howells said: “We’ve got a whole list of incentives, of good cases we’d like to do for the community. “One of the things we’d like to do on the actual landfill site, once we’ve cleaned it up and recovered that land, is put a power generation facility, maybe a couple of wind turbines. “We’d like to set up a community-owned mining facility which is using that clean electricity to create bitcoin for the people of Newport.” However the major issue Howells still has to overcome is getting permission from the council, who will not meet him to discuss his plans or entertain his ideas. A spokesperson for Newport city council said: “We have statutory duties which we must carry out in managing the landfill site. “Part of this is managing the ecological risk to the site and the wider area. Mr Howells’ proposals pose significant ecological risk which we cannot accept, and indeed are prevented from considering by the terms of our permit.”","publicationTime":1659444231.000000000,"title":"Man who threw away £150m in bitcoin hopes AI and robot dogs will get it back","id":"technology/2022/aug/02/man-hopes-ai-and-robot-dogs-will-help-recover-150m-in-bitcoin-from-landfill"},{"body":"In the bad old days, prospecting for gold was a grisly business involving hysterical crowds, pickaxes, digging, the wearing of appalling hats, standing in rivers panning for nuggets, “staking” claims and so on. The California gold rush of 1848-55, for example, brought 300,000 hopefuls to the Sierra Nevada and northern California and involved the massacre of thousands of Indigenous people. In our day, the new gold is bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, and prospecting for it has become a genteel armchair activity, although it is called “mining”, for old times’ sake. What it actually involves is using computers to perform unfathomably complicated calculations to create cryptographic “hashes” – codes that are, in practical terms, uncrackable. Sounds intimidating, doesn’t it? But in reality anyone can play the game. You just have to have the right kit – a special bitcoin-mining computer called an Asic (application-specific integrated circuit). These gizmos are readily available online. I’m looking at one as I write: the Bitmain Antminer S19, which costs $6,999 (£5,600) and can do 95 terahashes – 95tn calculations – every second. Mining is a misleading term for the computational work that’s needed to validate transactions on the blockchain – the cryptographically protected distributed ledger that underpins bitcoin. For every “block” that a miner is able to validate, they are rewarded with a number (currently 6.3) of new bitcoins. The value of the reward is tied to the prevailing price of the currency at the time. Not so long ago, for example, when each bitcoin stood at $68,000, that reward was worth nearly $430,000. So you can understand why bitcoin mining looks a bit like a contemporary version of what happened in California in the 1840s. While most of the hopeful arrivals then were Americans, there were also thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia and China. The Judge Business School in Cambridge, which has been tracking bitcoin mining for years, now finds that the US, with 37.84% of global hashrates, remains the biggest location, followed by China (21.11%), Kazakhstan (13.22%), Canada (6.48%) and Russia (4.66%). So bitcoin mining has become a global phenomenon. And while here and there there are small outfits diversifying into it, such as the Californian pancake-batter maker that bought an Asic after pancake sales plunged during the pandemic, most miners are now industrial-scale operations with large sheds of Asics in serried racks, looking for all the world like small-scale data centres of the kind run by Google and co. And, like data centres, they are power-hungry. That Bitmain Antminer machine, for example, has a power rating of 3,250 watts. It was recently estimated that bitcoin consumes about 110 terawatt hours per year, which is 0.55% of global electricity production, or roughly equivalent to the annual energy draw of countries such Malaysia or Sweden. For many operators, bitcoin mining has up to now been an astonishingly lucrative activity, with gross margins sometimes as high as 90%. But suddenly things have changed. First, bitcoin’s price has plunged – from its peak of $68,000 to $30,587 as I write this. And second, electricity prices have soared – by up to 70% in parts of the world, leading some industry experts to calculate that mining a single bitcoin can now cost up to $25,000. So the industry finds itself squeezed at both ends. Just like any ordinary business, in other words. There’s an agreeable sense of schadenfreude in all this. Bitcoin has been a fascinating phenomenon from the very beginning, but one that morphed under the pressure of greed. Originally conceived as a currency – that is, as a means of payment – it rapidly became perceived as an asset class and, in a time of low interest rates, was the subject of an hysterical speculative bubble that now seems to have deflated, even if it hasn’t definitively burst. Although it was predictable from the outset that, as the currency evolved, maintenance of its underpinning cryptographic blockchain would become ever-more onerous, it took a long time for the environmental consequences of that fact to be realised. But perhaps that’s a hallmark of every speculative bubble. It’s always difficult to get people to understand something if their wealth – real or anticipated – depends on their not understanding it. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left with the realisation that even the coolest idea can fry the planet.

Welch, a retired British property investor, hopes the tranquility will soon be shattered by 21,000 cryptocurrency investors he is trying to convince to move to his island and form a regulation-free “crypto utopia”. Under Welch’s plan, the 3 million sq metre (32 million sq ft) island, which is part of the Vanuatu archipelago between Australia and Fiji, would be transformed from 90% undisturbed rainforest into a “sustainable smart city”, filled with multistorey apartment blocks and offices for cryptocurrency investors from around the world. Welch, who has renamed the island from its native name Lataro to Satoshi (in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonym of the person who invented bitcoin), has joined forces with cryptocurrency evangelists to create a “blockchain-based democracy” and “the crypto capital of the world”. However, Welch will first have to unwind his previous marketing of the island as a “wildlife nature reserve” home to rare giant crabs. In his previous attempt to sell the island for $12m (£9m), Lataro is described as an ecological paradise “covered in lush rainforests, together with a wonderful array of flora and fauna that’s been here for thousands of years undisturbed and will surely make anyone believe they have gone back in time”. A video promoting the island for sale in 2017 boasts that the 4 miles of “pristine coral reef surrounding the island is a marine conservation area” that “teems with beautiful fish and coral life”. It says only a handful of people have ever dived at the reef and “most parts of it have never been explored”. The Welches have previously petitioned the Vanuatu government to designate the island as a wildlife reserve to “prevent the extinction” of the rare coconut crab. “The ultimate goal is to re-establish the breed strongly on the island,” Theresa said. A website describing the couple’s efforts to establish the wildlife reserve was deleted soon after the Guardian approached Welch for comment. He said the reserve was “voluntary” and one that he could “dismantle at any time” to allow for the building of the crypto city. “This was the last place with coconut crabs, they [the local population] had decimated them absolutely everywhere else on Espiritu Santo [Vanuatu’s largest island nearby],” Welch told the Guardian. “We formed the reserve to try to stop them decimating them here to get the numbers back up … the government department for the environment have supported us creating a wildlife refuge here.” The Satoshi island project is the latest in a series of schemes aimed at bringing cryptocurrency fanatics out from behind the blockchain in their bedrooms and into real-world community in small island states. The president of Palau, another Pacific island nation about 3,000 miles to the northeast of Vanuatu, has launched plans to become “the world’s first government-backed national stablecoin” by the end of the year. President Surangel Whipps Jr says the country has partnered with Ripple, a US cryptocurrency firm whose executives have been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission of stealing $1.3bn worth of the tokens, “to create a national digital currency, providing the citizens of Palau with greater financial access”. Plans to establish Cryptoland on an island in Fiji – where investors were told they would “enjoy a first-class crypto lifestyle” – collapsed earlier this month when the promoters failed to buy the island. Welch says Satoshi Island will succeed where Cryptoland failed because he and his partners own the island, and claims the development plans have the support of both the Vanuatu government and the local community. However, the Vanuatu government failed to respond to requests for comment, and Welch was unable to provide contact details for any current local residents. “We’re trying to build a community,” Welch said in an interview over satellite link to the island which currently has no mains electricity, water, phone or internet connection. “We’re not trying to develop and make a profit.” He said a team of cryptocurrency evangelists who had been searching the world for a location to form a “crypto society” approached Welch after seeing his island advertised for sale for $12m on private island real estate website. Welch took the island off the market and entered into a complex partnership with Hong Kong-based architect James Law, Australian crypto entrepreneur Denys Troyak and Daniel Agius, chief operating officer of the Vanuatu Investment Migration Bureau, an agency that sells Vanuatu citizenship. “The crypto paradise they want to build is a really cool idea, and a wonderful use of a place we have been able to live on for 12 years,” Welch said. “The team had been working to find a location for some time, the key issue was trying to find a government that would … permit a society to exist on crypto transactions. Most countries in the world want to collect tax, and they therefore don’t want crypto transactions happening because they can’t monitor what’s happening. Vanuatu has no income taxes of any sort.” The trio are promising 21,000 investors the island will “become home for crypto professionals and enthusiasts, with a goal to be considered the crypto capital of the world”. “Life on the island will be an experience like no other, giving the crypto community a way to live and work amongst like-minded people in a place designed around the industry we love,” they say on a website promoting the island. Successful applicants wanting to live on the island will be granted with a non-fungible token (NFT) granting them “Satoshi Island citizenship”. However, the small print details that they will also have to gain Vanuatu citizenship to live on the island. Vanuatu citizenship costs $130,000 and allows “golden passport” visa-free travel to 129 countries, including the UK and all Schengen countries in Europe. The country is heavily promoting its “citizenship by investment” programme despite concerns that the scheme has been exploited by fugitives, politicians and disgraced businesspeople. A Guardian investigation last year found that among the 2,200 foreign nationals granted citizenship in 2020 were a Syrian businessman with US sanctions against his businesses, a suspected North Korean politician, an Italian businessman accused of extorting the Vatican and South African brothers accused of a $3.6bn cryptocurrency heist. Vanuatu this month appointed Mayfair-based citizenship marketing firm CS Global Partners to attract more to buy Vanuatu nationality, which is granted with an online “oath swearing ceremony” and does not require the new citizen to ever visit the country. Selling citizenships equates to almost 50% of Vanuatu’s total annual revenue, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). • This article was amended on 12 February 2022.

The UK economy is expected to shrink this year and will be at the back of the leading G7 countries during 2023, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The IMF has lifted its forecast for the UK’s economy this year – it is now expected to shrink by 0.3%, not the 0.6% fall in GDP previously expected. That would leave the UK lagging behind other advanced economies this year. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters in Washington DC that UK growth this year has been stronger than than expected, but that the UK was vulnerable to a trade shock from high imported energy costs. The tight labour market has also led to higher interest rates to fight inflation, Gourinchas told reporters in Washington DC. The IMF also warned that the global economy could suffer a “hard landing” if persistently troublesome inflation forces interest rates to stay higher for longer. But it has also predicted interest rates will fall back towards pre-pandemic levels, due to weak productivity and aging populations. Tony Danker, the head of the Confederation of British Industry, says he was shocked to be dismissed today following an investigation into complaints about his conduct in the workplace. Danker added that he was “truly sorry” for making colleagues “feel uncomfortable”. He’s being replaced by former CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith. The business lobby group said it wanted to make clear that Danker was not the subject of other complaints recently reported by the Guardian.

Tupperware, the 77-year-old company famed for its airtight food containers, has warned it could go bust if it cannot raise emergency funds to stay afloat. Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economist, fears that the IMF’s new growth forecasts are too optimistic. The IMF forecasts that world growth will drop to 2.8% this year, from 3.4% in 2022, before rising to 3% in 2024. McFee says the new projections underestimate the impact of tighter financial conditions on advanced economies, saying: The IMF’s forecast still looks too optimistic over the next 2 years in our view. The impact of bank funding turmoil looks to have been offset in their forecasts by the positive developments in European energy markets, solid economic momentum and China’s earlier than expected reopening, to leave the IMF’s global GDP projection broadly unchanged. But we think their forecasts underestimate the impact that tightening in financial conditions will have on advanced economies in second half of this year and next. Our latest global forecast – to be published tomorrow – is more downbeat this year and next. We expect growth in PPP terms of 2.3% this year and 2.8% next, which is weak by historical standards. This equates to 1.9% and 2.2% respectively on a constant exchange rates basis – our preferred measure of global activity. A key difference in our thinking seems to be that we expect more of an economic impact from tighter financial conditions in advanced economies than the IMF. Consequently, our 2024 forecasts for GDP growth in the US, Canada and the eurozone are more cautious. With the fallout from bank funding turmoil still to be fully realised, we maintain the view that there are substantial downside risks to our forecast. The IMF appears to agree, assigning a 25% probability that global growth will fall below 2% in 2023. Ryan Myerberg, portfolio manager and co-head of global taxable fixed income at Brown Advisory, agrees that higher borrowing costs are hitting the world economy, and worrying investors: “We agree with the IMF when it says that the recalibration of growth is lower as tighter monetary policy continues to bite. We have long been pounding the table over the impact that the last 12 plus months of hikes will have on interest rate-sensitive parts of the global economy and its role in creating an environment of nervous investors, which means every wobble and crack that appears will be magnified. This is especially true as liquidity conditions in all asset classes continues to get worse.” City of London Police has launched an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Business (CBI) in the wake of the Guardian’s coverage of allegations at the business organisation, my colleague Ben Quinn reports. The force told the Guardian that it had approached the CBI following media reports, and that its investigation was at a very early stage. The Guardian reported last week that more than a dozen women claimed to have been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI, including one who alleges she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the River Thames. The, which is responsible for law enforcement within the City of London, including the Middle and Inner Temples, released a statement after it was approached by the Guardian on Tuesday. A spokesperson said: “The City of London Police takes all acts of sexual misconduct and violence against women and girls extremely seriously.” “We approached the CBI following media reports and our investigations are at a very early stage. It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has appointed Megan Greene, the global chief economist at Kroll, to the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee. Greene will replace professor Silvana Tenreyro, one of the most dovish members of the MPC, when her term ends in July. Hunt says: Megan Greene’s wide experience across financial markets and the real economy will bring valuable new expertise to the MPC. I am delighted to appoint her to this role and look forward to seeing her contribution to policymaking in the coming years. I would also like to thank Professor Silvana Tenreyro for all her work since she joined the Bank of England, and wish her the best in the next stage of her career. Greene is also Senior Fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. She has previously worked as a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, and as global chief economist at John Hancock/Manulife Asset Management. She was also director of European Economics at Roubini Global Economics in 2011 and 2022, when she helped us cover the eurozone crisis. Greene will join the Bank of England at a time when the central bank may have lifted interest rates to their peak in the current cycle (depending if inflation falls as expected, or not). Reuters’ Andy Bruce has flagged some of her recent views on the UK economy: IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas also points out that higher corporate prices, rather than rising wages, are playing a substantial role pushing up inflation. Gourinchas says the ‘natural response’ of the economic system is for prices to rise when there is increased demand for goods and services. Wages tent to take some time to adjust, he points out, as they are adjusted less frequently. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, has told reporters in Washington that “forceful action” by the Bank of England calmed the markets “very quickly” after the turmoil in the government bond market last autumn. Gourinchas says the “brief instability” in the gilts market (after the mini-budget) was an example of rapid rises in interest rates creating pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector. It prompted the Bank of England to pledge to buy up to £65bn of gilts to calm the markets, and avoid pension funds blowing up. On the upward revision to the UK’s growth forecast, to a -0.3% contraction this year, Gourinchas explains that growth this year has been stronger than than expected. We are seeing a little bit of a better performance for the UK economy. There is slightly less fiscal contraction in the pipeline. So why is the UK performing worse than other G7 members? Gourinchas says there is a higher dependence on imported energy, creating a trade shock, while the tight labour market has led to higher interest rates to fight inflation. Gourinchas also told the news conference today that central bank financial stability actions should not take precedence over moves to calm inflation -- unless a severe financial crisis occurs. Gourinchas explained that there could be situations where near-term stability risks could take precedence, such as a crisis that moves beyond the severe adverse “risk-off” scenario in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. He explained: “It doesn’t mean that you would abandon any nominal anchor but it means that in the near term, you would have to put financial stability first. The IMF’s forecasts once again make for “grim reading” in their assessment of the UK economy and the global economy more generally, warns Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at asset management firm abrdn. Bartholomew thinks the IMF is on the right lines with its assessment of the UK, but too optimistic about the US economy: “Precise growth forecasts are notoriously difficult to get right, and no doubt the IMF will be wrong in the specifics of their numerical forecasts. But we agree with the broad message of the forecasts that the UK economy is likely to endure recession-like conditions for much of this year. “We don’t think the IMF is pessimistic enough on US growth as we expect ongoing credit condition tightening to tip the US economy into recession later this year, with large spillovers to the rest of the world. Bartholomew adds that the most interesting aspect of the IMF’s analysis could be its prediction that interest rates will fall back towards their pre-pandemic levels (as covered earlier this morning): “Over the long run, interest rates are pinned down by slow moving forces like demographics and inequality, and the IMF sees little reason to think these have been fundamentally changed since the pandemic. If the IMF is right about this, and we are right about a recession, the debate will move to how much central banks are likely to cut interest rates in the coming years. Investors may find this period of high interest rates was simply a brief interruption of the low-rate world they have been dealing with since the global financial crisis.” Britain’s economy is being held back by the ‘botched’ Brexit deal agreed by the government says Layla Moran, Lib Dem MP and member of the UK Trade and Business Commission. Commenting on today’s IMF forecasts, showing the UK will shrink by 0.3% this year, Moran explains: “This isn’t rocket science. The UK is the only developed economy with the added pressures of Brexit where businesses face extra costs, mountains of new red tape and amplified labour shortages. “Our economy will continue to underperform until this incompetent Conservative government owns up to and fixes the issues caused by their botched Brexit deal.” Rachel Reeves MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, warns the IMF’s new economic outlook highlights that the UK is lagging behind. Reeves says: IMF projections that Britain will have a smaller economy by the end of the year, and the poorest growth in the G7 over this year and next, shows just how far we continue to lag behind on the global stage. This matters not just because 13 years of low growth under the Tories are weakening our economy, but because it’s why families are worse off, facing a Tory mortgage penalty and seeing living standards falling at their fastest rate since records began. The government should be easing the cost of living crisis now, by backing Labour’s plan to freeze council tax this year, funded by a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants. And they must get our economy growing - matching the ambition and plan behind Labour’s mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has responded to today’s IMF forecasts: Thanks to the steps we have taken, the OBR says the UK will avoid recession, and our IMF growth forecasts have been upgraded by more than any other G7 country. The IMF now say we are on the right track for economic growth. By sticking to the plan we will more than halve inflation this year, easing the pressure on everyone. This chart from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook shows the latest forecasts, and the changes compared with January. As you can see, Spain got a 0.4% growth bump for this year (but they’re not a G7 member), while the UK’s projected downturn in 2023 was revised up to -0.3% from -0.6%. And on inflation, the IMF forecast that Britain’s consumer prices index will average 6.8% in 2023, down from 9.1% in 2022, and then fall further to 3% in 2024. The IMF is also forecasting that global growth will bottom out this year: With the UK at the back of the pack: The UK economy is expected to shrink this year and will be at the back of the leading G7 countries at a time when a fresh outbreak of financial upheaval threatens the slowing global recovery, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Stressing the growing risks of a hard landing for developed countries, the Washington-based body singled out the UK and the euro area as being particularly affected by rising energy costs and higher inflation, my colleague Larry Elliott reports from Washington DC. The IMF slightly revised up its estimate of UK growth this year from the -0.6% pencilled in three months ago but still expected the economy to contract by 0.3%. And here’s Larry’s analysis on the Fund’s latest assessment of the world economy: The IMF warns today that the global economy has reached another “highly uncertain moment” in its rocky recovery. The Fund’s World Economic Outlook begins by pointing out that inflation reached multidecade highs last year in many economies, due to pent-up demand, supply chain problems and commodity price spikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That led central banks to tighten aggressively by raising interest rates. The Fund warns that “the fog around the world economic outlook has thickened”, partly due to the recent increase in financial market volatility due to jitters in the banking sector. It fears that a ‘hard landing’ (where central bankers drive economies into recession) is a larger risk. The WEO cautions that: Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled. The major forces that affected the world in 2022 — central banks’ tight monetary stances to allay inflation, limited fiscal buffers to absorb shocks amid historically high debt levels, commodity price spikes and geoeconomic fragmentation with Russia’s war in Ukraine, and China’s economic reopening — seem likely to continue into 2023. But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns. A hard landing— particularly for advanced economies—has become a much larger risk. Policymakers may face difficult trade-offs to bring sticky inflation down and maintain growth while also preserving financial stability. Newsflash: the UK is on track to be the worst-performing advanced economy this year. The International Monetary Fund has forecast UK GDP will shrink by 0.3% in 2023, worse than other G7 countries. That’s an improvement on the Fund’s previous forecasts, though, when the UK was expected to contract by 0.6% this year. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, just released, predicts that the UK will then grow by 1% in 2024. The US, in contrast, is forecast to grow by 1.6% this year, and 1.1% in 2024. The eurozone is expected to expand by 0.8% in 2023, and accelerate to 1.4% growth next year. Germany, though, is forecast to shrink slightly, by 0.1%, in 2023, and grow by 1.1% in 2024. France (+0.7%, then 1.3%), Italy (+0.7% then 0.8%) and Spain (+1.5% then 2%) are all seen growing this year and next. As are Canada (+1.5% in both years), and Japan (+1.3% in 2023, then 1% in 2024). Even Russia is expected to grow this year (by 0.7%) and in 2024 (by 1.3%), after a 2.1% contraction last year. Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said developments at the CBI were “incredibly concerning”, PA Media reports. Responding to the sacking of Tony Danker, the head of the business organisation, Labour’s shadow chancellor told broadcasters during a visit to Brighton: Obviously what is happening at the CBI is incredibly concerning and it’s important that these reviews are able to take their course. Labour, like the government, have cut our ties and are not currently doing any engagement with the CBI whilst these inquiries are ongoing. Meetings between ministers and the Confederation of British Industry remain paused while the organisation continues its investigation into misconduct allegations, Downing Street has said. The dismissal of CBI chief Tony Danker will not end the move by ministers and officials to cancel engagements with the organisation, a No 10 spokesman told reporters. The spokesman said: His departure is a matter for the CBI, but we continue to expect any allegations to be taken seriously and for appropriate action to be taken in response. While the CBI continues to investigate we will pause engagement by ministers and senior officials with the CBI. The government suspended its relationship with the Confederation of British Industry last week, after the Guardian revealed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by the lobby group’s staff. As well as launching “a root-and-branch review” of its culture, governance and processes, the CBI is to create a new position of chief people officer. They will sit on its executive committee and report directly to the CBI’s board on all matters of workplace conduct and culture. The CBI HR director, Lauren Adams, will fill the role on an interim basis while a “wide-ranging external recruitment process” is conducted. The CBI’s board added this morning that: The current independent and confidential channel outside the CBI for people to come forward with concerns and complaints about workplace conduct will be made permanent. We also recognise the enormous strain this experience has placed on all our people and will continue to offer support to anyone who needs it. The Financial Times reports that a former female CBI staffer who had previously raised a complaint over an inappropriate comment about her appearance by a senior CBI figure, welcomed the appointment of the new director-general to replace Tony Danker. She said: The board finally found its guts. Rain Newton-Smith will have the confidence of the staff and the members who know her to be on the right side of sexual misconduct issues. Newton-Smith, the CBI’s former chief economist for over eight years, spent her early career as an economist at the Bank of England, and then Oxford Economics. She left the CBI in March to join Barclays as managing director for Strategy and Policy, Sustainability and ESG. Tony Danker says he was ‘shocked’ to learn he has been dismissed by the CBI this morning. Danker has tweeted that he was appalled to learn last week about the “revelations of awful events that occurred before my time in office”. He adds he was “shocked to learn this morning that I had been dismissed from the CBI, instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed”. Danker also says he is “truly sorry” to have unintentionally made a number of colleagues feel uncomfortable, and wishes his former colleagues every success. Elizabeth Gardiner, CEO at UK Whistleblowing charity Protect, says the CBI’s new director-general, Rain Newton-Smith, has an opportunity to address and change the organisation’s whistleblowing procedures. Gardiner explains: What CBI should be doing is reviewing its current arrangements, regular training of managers on how to be good recipients of bad news, and checking that staff are aware of and confident in the processes. Whistleblowers provide employers a gift of information – an early warning that something is wrong. Failure to listen can lead to harm to individuals, organisations and the public interest. Confidence among small US firms has dipped, as the inflation continues to worry business owners. The US small business confidence index produced by NFIB (the National Federation of Independent Business) has fallen by 0.8 points to 90.1 in March, from 90.9. This is the 15th month running that the index has been below its long-term average of 90%. NFIB says twenty-four percent of owners reported inflation as their single most important business problem, down four points from last month. The ratio of small business owners expecting better business conditions over the next six months remain at a net negative 47%. NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg says: Small business owners are cynical about future economic conditions. Hiring plans fell to their lowest level since May 2020, but strong consumer spending has kept Main Street alive and supported strong labor demand. Over in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss the situation on the currency market with Russia’s central bank chief and finance minister later on Tuesday, the Kremlin says. The meeting comes as the Russian rouble dropped near a one-year low against the US dollar and the euro. The rouble has lost almost 1% today to around 82.2 to the dollar, having last week hit its lowest level since March 2022. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the rouble slumped to 120/$, but then recovered as capital controls were imposed to prop up the currency. Deal news: The US private equity investor KKR has bought a 30% stake in financial PR firm FGS Global. The deal values FGS Global at around $1.4bn, as had been rumoured last week. Existing investor Golden Gate Capital is selling its entire stake to KKR. The group is also buying shares from senior employees at the firm and its largest investors, including London-based advertising giant WPP (which will still hold a majority stake), Reuters reports. FGS was formed in 2020 through the merger of London’s Finsbury, Germany’s Hering Schuppener, and the Glover Park Group, before then buying US-based Sard Verbinnen in October 2021 (updated). Finsbury was founded in 1994 by Roland Rudd, the brother of the former UK home secretary Amber Rudd and a leading campaigner against Brexit. Rudd is now one of three co-chairs of FGS Global, alongside Carter Eskew and George Sard. Mark Read, CEO of WPP, says KKR’s transaction “recognizes the tremendous value of the business and its potential for continued strong growth.” As we reported last week: Investment firms have made a series of deals in recent years for stakes in public relations companies, who advise big corporate clients on how to communicate with journalists on issues ranging from regular financial results to crisis management. Here’s an explanation, published last weekend, about the allegations of misconduct by senior managers at the Confederation of British Industry: The allegations have led some CBI members to consider whether they should leave the lobbying group: Last week the Uk government suspended its relationship with the CBI, while the investigation into these fresh allegations was conducted. Central banks will probably start cutting interest rates soon, predicts Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool. He tells us: IMF predictions that central banks will cut interest rates soon will most likely materialize sooner than the Fund expects. Why? The very latest movements in the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) which predicts inflation movements quite well (as I explain here) indicate that inflation pressures are receding extremely fast. In fact, supply chain pressures have collapsed! This suggests to me that Central Banks will be “forced” to cut interest rates quite soon. Back to economics… and investor morale in the euro zone has improved this month. Research institute Sentix’s gauge of current conditions in the eurozone has hit its highest level in over a year, rising to -8.7 points for April after dipping to -11.1 in March. However, Sentix’s economic expectations index remained at -13.0. Sentix says its latest data is “better, but still not good”, and shows that the Eurozone economy continues to recover at the beginning of April. They explain: “There is no doubt that the euro zone economy has weathered the winter months better than many feared in the fall. Tony Danker, the boss of the Confederation of British Industry, has been dismissed with immediate effect after an investigation into complaints about his conduct in the workplace. The CBI hired a law firm to investigate him after the Guardian approached the business group about a formal complaint that was made in January, as well a number of alleged informal reports of concerns over his behaviour. The business lobby group said it wanted to make clear that Danker was not the subject of other complaints recently reported by the Guardian. Those other claims by more than a dozen women allege various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the organisation. However, the board of the CBI added they had determined that Danker’s conduct “fell short of that expected of the director general”. The CBI’s plight is a warning to other UK organisations, and an opportunity to look at their own internal culture, writes journalist and broadcaster Josie Cox today. She says the allegations of misconduct at the business lobbying group are another reminder that wherever there is money there is power… and that “where there is power, abuse – in some form – is frequently still rife”. Cox explains: Despite ostensible efforts by some of Britain’s biggest companies to create equal opportunities and appropriate representation for all genders and races within the workplace, businesses remain stubbornly skewed. They’re predominantly led by white men and blighted by the pay gap and the authority gap, in which women find it more difficult to be taken seriously at work. As a function of these chasms, troubling power dynamics allow for cultures of sexism and, in some cases, toxic masculinity to prevail. More here: Brian McBride, CBI president, says: Rain is well-known and highly respected at the CBI, and by its membership. She is the right leader for the organisation, possessing deep knowledge of the challenges facing businesses who are trying to grow in these challenging economic times. I have every confidence that she will provide the clear-sighted leadership that the CBI and UK business needs. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s new director-general, is rejoining the business group from Barclays, where she recently became managing director for Strategy and Policy, Sustainability and ESG at Barclays. Newton-Smith, who worked as the CBI’s chief economist from summer 2014 until this March, says: It’s a huge privilege to be asked to return to the CBI to serve as its director-general. I passionately believe in the power of business to transform our society. I want the CBI to be an organisation of which we can all be proud. I am grateful and determined to lead the team through this challenging time. I look forward to working with the team, our members and stakeholders as we work together to achieve sustainable growth. Tony Danker, the head of the boss of the Confederation of British Industry, has been fired after an investigation into his conduct. The board of the CBI has announced that Danker had been dismissed with immediate effect following the independent investigation into specific complaints of workplace misconduct against him. He will be replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, a former CBI chief economist. The business group’s board says: The Board wishes to make clear he is not the subject of any of the more recent allegations in The Guardian but has determined that his own conduct fell short of that expected of the Director General. The CBI adds that three other CBI employees are now suspended pending further investigation into a number of ongoing allegations. Danker stepped aside as CBI chief in early March, after the Guardian approached the CBI about a formal complaint about his conduct that had been made in January. Earlier this month, we reported that more than a dozen women have claimed to have been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the Confederation of British Industry, including one who alleges she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the River Thames. The CBI adds that: While Fox Williams continues with the next phase of its inquiry, the CBI is liaising with the police and has made clear its intention to cooperate fully with any police investigations. The CBI’s board says today: The allegations that have been made over recent weeks about the CBI have been devastating. While investigations continue into a number of these, it is already clear to all of us that there have been serious failings in how we have acted as an organisation. We must do better, and we must be better. We apologise to the victims of this organisational failure, including those impacted by the revulsion we have all felt at hearing their stories. Nobody should feel unsafe in their workplace Shipping costs are continuing to ease, which should help to pull down inflation and lead to lower interest rates: The recent banking crisis, and expectations that interest rates could soon peak, has spurred demand for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, reports Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor. That’s squeezing investors who had bet against Bitcoin, she reports: “Bitcoin surpassed the psychological resistance level, $30,000 for the first time since June as the 2023 crypto rally continues. Bitcoin is up 80% against the US dollar so far this year but remains sharply below the peak from the final quarter of 2021. Turmoil in the banking sector and speculation that the Fed could be nearing the peak of the rate hiking cycle have bolstered demand for cryptos, helping bitcoin stage a recovery after it logged a more than 60% slide last year, its second-worse annual performance on record. There is growing speculation that bitcoin is at the start of another bull run. Shorts have been getting squeezed this year, prompting more buying as the bears rush to cover their losing positions.” Bitcoin has hit a 10-month high this morning, as the crypto currency continues to rally. Bitcoin has climbed to above $30,000 for the first time since last June, which is almost double the lows hit hit last autumn. However, it’s still over 50% below the record highs set in November 2021, before sliding through 2022. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, predicts the rally will continue, saying: Bitcoin’s crypto winter is finally gone today, as the price has broken above a critical barrier level of $30,000. Bitcoin has already recovered about half of its losses from its all-time high, and it is up more than 100% from the crypto winter lows. The present price pattern is expected to generate a lot of attention, as well as FOMO among investors, many of whom have already missed out as the price has regained its significant losses. Yet, we do feel that the moment has come to be a strategic investor in cryptocurrency, since we believe that the path of least resistance for Bitcoin is skewed to the upside and that the present surge is simply the beginning of what is to come. Bill Blain, market strategist at Shard Capital, says he doesn’t have faith in crypto, citing its “zero legal utility”, regulatory vulnerability, and instability. But, Blain writes, other traders who bought into bitcoin at the start of the year are sitting on profits, having concluded it was cheap at the start of the year. I had my moment of market epiphany Sunday afternoon on the sailing club deck…. A chum told me he’s nearly doubled his money buying Bitcoin since buying in January at £13.75k and its now trading around £24.3k – he’s going to hold (“Hodl”) his sizeable bottom-fished position, confident it’s going to hit a new record high this year – at which point he will buy a new car. Nice. Another sailing mate then told me he follows the candle charts, and reckons there are some seriously bullish signals revealed by “Bollinger Band” analysis of the Bitcoin price action – it’s going to break higher he confidently told me. Neither is a professional investor; they are smart guys watching the markets, looking to make some money. They know its going higher! European stock markets have opened higher today, as traders digest the IMF’s forecast that interest rates will fall back. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 54 points, or 0.7%, to 7795 points, its highest level in over four weeks, as trading resumes after the Easter break. Investors are also cheered by the fall in China’s inflation, and factory prices, overnight. UK consumers cut back on groceries, clothes shopping and eating out last month but streaming and pay TV subscriptions jumped as cash-conscious viewers switched to nights in. The return of big hit series such as Succession, The Mandalorian and Ted Lasso fuelled a healthy 4.1% increase in spend on digital content and subscriptions in March, the highest year-on-year rise in five months, according to Barclays’ regular snapshot of consumer credit and debit card use. However, consumers seeking to balance household budgets cut back going out to restaurants, which resulted in monthly spend falling 5.6%, while spend in clothing stores fell 3.4% – the sharpest drop in six months. Here’s the full story: Data from China overnight shows that its inflation rate has hit an 18-month low. China’s consumer price index rose by just 0.7% in the year to March, the slowest pace since September 2021, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. That’s a slowdown on February’s 1% increase, and weaker than the 1.0% rise forecast by economists. China’s factories continued to cut prices too, which could lead to lower prices worldwide. The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.5% year-on-year, the fastest pace since June 2020, accelerating from the 1.4% drop seen in February. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says the data shows China’s recovery is losing steam after pandemic restrictions were lifted. Chinese consumer inflation read weaker than expected in March, while producer price inflation contracted steadily amid growing signs that a post-COVID economic recovery in the country, especially in the manufacturing sector, was losing steam. With PPI falling, simply connect the dots as the data speaks loud and clear that consumer spending is still struggling to pick up. Not all economists agree with the IMF’s view that the natural rate of interest will fall back to pre-Covid levels, once the inflation shock has abated. Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has predicted that rates will be substantially higher on average in the years ahead. Last month, Summers suggested the real neutral rate might be in the range of 1.5% to 2% going forward. He believes that increased government borrowing, partly to fund defense spending, will keep borrowing costs higher. Indeed, the IMF’s team of economists agrees there are a few reasons why its assumptions could be wrong. For example, they say, government support may be difficult to withdraw, increasing public debt. Second, the costs of the green energy transition could also push up deficits. Thirdly, “deglobalization forces could intensify”, leading to both trade and financial fragmentation and pushing up the cost of borrowing. The head of the World Bank has revealed that it has lifted its growth forecast for this year. Reuters has the details: World Bank Group President David Malpass said on Monday that the lender has revised its 2023 global growth outlook slightly upward to 2% from a January forecast of 1.7% but the slowdown from stronger 2022 growth will increase debt distress for developing countries. Malpass told a media briefing that the upward revision was due to an improved outlook for China’s recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns, with growth now pegged at 5.1% this year compared to 4.3% in the bank’s January Global Economic Prospects report. Advanced economies, including the U.S. and in Europe, are also doing a bit better than the World Bank anticipated in January, Malpass said as the World Bank’s and International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meetings week kicked off. While this is a growth upgrade for this year, it’s still weaker than the 3% growth which the World Bank expected nine months ago. Malpass also warned that the recent turmoil in the banking sector and higher oil prices could weigh on growth prospects in the second half of this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Interest rates are set to fall back to levels seen before the outbreak of Covid-19 once inflation has been tamed. That’s the message from the International Monetary Fund this morning, as top economists and central bankers head to Washington DC for its Spring meeting. A team of IMF economists have examined the ‘natural rate of interest’ – the interest rate which keeps inflation on target while neither stimulating nor hampering economic growth. Their conclusion: the recent increases in real interest rates are “likely to be temporary”, due to factors such as sluggish productivity growth and aging populations. They predict the natural rates in advanced economies “will likely remain low”, while those in emerging markets are likely to drop towards those levels. That would mean interest rates would fall towards the lows seen in the pandemic. In the UK, interest rates were cut from 0.75% to just 0.1% in early 2020 (they’re currently 4.25%). The IMF say: When inflation is brought back under control, advanced economies’ central banks are likely to ease monetary policy and bring real interest rates back towards pre-pandemic levels. How close to those levels will depend on whether alternative scenarios involving persistently higher government debt and deficits, or financial fragmentation materialize. In large emerging markets, conservative projections of future demographic and productivity trends suggest a gradual convergence towards advanced economies’ real interest rates. The natural rate is an important anchor for monetary policy, as central bankers try to set interest rates to keep rising prices in check without driving people out of work. So if the IMF are right, it’s a boost for borrowers such as households struggling with mortgage payments. But, it would suggest central bankers could be left with less firepower to fight the next downturn, if major economies are saddled with chronically weak productivity and smaller workforces due to demographic changes. The work is part of the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook, which will be released later today. The Fund will also release a new Global Financial Stability Report as part of its annual spring meetings with the World Bank in Washington. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, warned last week that the global economy is heading for the weakest period of growth since 1990, as the surge in interest rates to fight inflation hits the global economy.

He runs Lavender.Five, a crypto validator service that authenticates transactions on the blockchain (imagine a deregulated branch of the Securities and Exchange Commission). On 25 February, he issued a plea to his 1,700 Twitter followers, “We’ll match any donation made to a charity in support of Ukraine, up to a total of $1,000.” The next day, Schultz posted the fruits of his initiative; 0.028 bitcoin, equaling the total donations of about $1,100, sent to a crypto wallet operated by a Ukrainian military NGO called Come Back Alive. He’s one tiny part of a chorus of countless other crypto holders all over the world who have raced to back Ukrainians in the face of an invading force. Reports claim that more than $30m in cryptocurrency has been funneled to the country since the war began. So has charity finally become decentralized? “I decided early on that Lavender.Five would use its platform to make a positive difference, no matter how small,” says Schultz. “Crypto is inherently worldwide. To donate using traditional currency often requires intermediaries. You can’t donate USD directly, you first need to convert it in some way, or find an intermediary … Cryptocurrency solves this by simplifying the process. If you have the address for the charity, you can simply enter the address, enter the amount to donate, and hit send.” Ukraine, like many former Soviet states, has battled corruption and a severe dearth of international funding since gaining independence in 1991. So maybe that is why the Ukrainian government took the unusual step of tweeting out crypto wallet codes for global financing through both bitcoin and Ethereum – the two most popular digital tokens – from official accounts. “Stand with the people of Ukraine Now accepting cryptocurrency donations,” wrote Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, on 26 February. Non-profits and local businesses in the besieged country have mirrored the government’s request. The Kyiv Independent, an English language newspaper in the capital city, is accepting patronage through bitcoin. Come Back Alive, the NGO that Schultz contributed to, was previously active on Patreon – processing traditional currency donations – before being terminated from the platform because it violated an existing moratorium on military fundraisers. Naturally, the firm found a second life thanks to a “crypto collective” called UkraineDAO which is collecting decentralized aid for a variety of Ukrainian organizations. As the state is gradually dragged into brutal urban warfare, perhaps it makes sense that the residents are petitioning for an untrackable currency – particularly as donations can be anonymous and therefore avoid any retaliation from the Russian state. “Blockchain allows us to scale our efforts in a way that wasn’t possible for us before,” said Nadya Tolokonnikova, a spokeswoman for Ukraine DAO, in an interview with the New York Times. “The old ways of raising money sometimes are really slow and just clumsy.” For the most ardent cryptocurrency diehards, the crisis in Ukraine is a perfect encapsulation of the reasons why they believe the global economic hegemony needs to be broken up. The Ukrainian people need help, and they argue that bitcoin’s ability to eschew bureaucratic red tape is the best way to provide immediate service to a vulnerable population. “It’s just the cheapest, fastest and most secure way to transact financially,” says Artemis, who declined to offer his real name but says heis from Canada and donated $280 in bitcoin to Come Back Alive. “They can safely store it without any fear of the invading force stealing it, or the banking system collapsing due to war.” That said, donors still need to be doing their due diligence to avoid potential scams, particularly in a chaotic active war zone. Nobody should trust a stray crypto wallet floating through social media without corroborating the details. Especially when there are organizations such as The Giving Block, a charity curator that opens up blockchain pathways to non-profits, which requires a vetting process to be featured on the platform. Even in the wild west of crypto, it is possible for patrons to know their alms are going to the right place – although not all the Ukrainian groups currently accepting crypto donations have opened themselves up to this kind of transparency. There’s also plenty of evidence that the crypto revolution could threaten the Ukrainian home front. Foreign policy experts are warning that the Russian economy could become increasingly reliant on the blockchain as crippling sanctions wreak havoc on Moscow. The rouble is worth less than one cent after a 30% swoon after the US and Europe cut off Russian banks from Swift. Crypto is much more resistant to punitive financial assault, and that provides an escape route for a country that’s been completely isolated from civic banking. “It is most likely already happening. We know Russia is already developing its own digital currency, the digital rouble, that it will use to trade globally. Sanctions aimed at hurting Putin will only hurt the Russian people. What is certain is that Putin has already thought about this prior to the conflict with Ukraine and has a plan that probably involves crypto,” says Mark Basa, HOKK Finance global brand and business manager. The war efforts, on both sides, may be funded in the inky blackness of the blockchain. Crypto is often simultaneously a force for good and a force for evil, but the stakes of that dichotomy have never been quite this high. For his part, Schultz intends to keep supporting Ukrainians with his tokens. “Ukraine didn’t want this, and is fighting the battle on their own,” she says. “I wanted to help however I can, by reaching as many as I can.”","publicationTime":1646312409.000000000,"title":"Every bitcoin helps: why Ukraine is soliciting for cryptocurrency donations","id":"technology/2022/mar/03/bitcoin-donations-cryptocurrency-support-ukraine"},{"body":"A leading US tech investment firm that counts Facebook and Twitter among its successful bets has backed the UK’s approach to crypto regulation as it announced plans to open a London office that will be its first outside the US. California-based Andreesen Horowitz said Britain was on “the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation”. The venture capital firm’s new office will open later this year and will be dedicated to investing in crypto and tech startups in the UK and Europe. The move comes amid a crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry in the US, where the financial watchdog is suing the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, in a legal complaint that accuses the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, of “placing investors’ assets at significant risk”. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has a lawsuit against Coinbase, Binance’s closest rival, accusing it of operating an illegal exchange. Chris Dixon, the head of crypto investing at Andreesen Horowitz, wrote in a blogpost: “While there is still work to be done, we believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation. “The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.” Rishi Sunak said he was thrilled that the firm had chosen the UK, a move he said was “testament to our world-class universities and talent and our strong competitive business environment”. Dixon said UK politicians and regulators were taking an approach “uniquely tailored” to regulating digital assets and blockchain, a decentralised form of record keeping that tracks the ownership of a cryptocurrency but has other uses such as underpinning contracts. Last year, Dixon’s firm announced a $4.5bn (£3.57bn) fund to invest in crypto and blockchain companies. The Treasury has published a consultation document on bringing crypto regulation in line with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, in a process that refers to balancing “risk as well as opportunity” in the sector. Andreesen Horowitz hopes that the Treasury’s approach to crypto regulation will set the pace globally. The EU, a leader in tech regulation, has also introduced a crypto framework, introducing a regulation on markets in crypto-assets, or MiCA. However, there are also signs of hostility to the sector among policymakers. The UK parliament’s cross-party Treasury committee said last month that UK authorities should regulate cryptocurrency trading as a form of gambling, warning in a report that digital assets such as bitcoin have “no intrinsic value”. The UK financial regulator is also toughening regulations. This month, the Financial Conduct Authority announced new rules for crypto advertising, including the requirement that firms promoting crypto products or services carry a clear risk warning in their adverts.","publicationTime":1686570146.000000000,"title":"Top US tech investor to open office in UK citing crypto-friendly approach","id":"business/2023/jun/12/us-tech-investment-firm-andreesen-horowitz-tnew-london-office-cryptocurrencies"},{"body":"The cryptocurrency lender Genesis has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US, becoming the latest victim of the shakeout in the digital asset market after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Genesis Global Capital, one of three Genesis entities that applied for bankruptcy protection on Thursday, froze customer withdrawals on 16 November, days after FTX made its own Chapter 11 filing. The lender said it had assets and liabilities in the range of $1bn to $10bn, and estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors in its filing with the US bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York. Genesis Global Holdco, the parent group of Genesis Global Capital, also filed for bankruptcy protection, along with another lending unit, Genesis Asia Pacific. Genesis Global Holdco said options under consideration included a sale and that it had $150m in cash to support the restructuring. Under a Chapter 11 process, a struggling company is sheltered from creditors temporarily while it attempts to restructure its finances. Genesis’s derivatives and spot trading, broker dealer and custody businesses were not part of the bankruptcy process, and would continue their client trading operations, the holding company said. The bankruptcy filing is the latest in a cascade of crypto failures and steep job cuts triggered by plunging digital asset prices last year. Last year, Genesis extended $130.6bn in crypto loans and traded $116.5bn in assets, according to its website. Its two biggest borrowers were Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based crypto hedge fund, and Alameda Research, a trading company closely affiliated with FTX, a source told Reuters. Three Arrows, Alameda and FTX are in bankruptcy proceedings. Three Arrows’ debt to Genesis was assumed by its parent company, the venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), which then filed a claim against Three Arrows. DCG’s portfolio companies also include the crypto asset manager Grayscale and news service CoinDesk. Crypto lenders, which acted as de facto banks, boomed during the pandemic. But unlike traditional banks, they are not required to hold capital cushions. This year, a shortfall of collateral forced some lenders – and their customers – to shoulder large losses. However, the price of bitcoin, the cornerstone crypto asset, has recovered since the FTX collapse and is trading above $20,000 after hovering at about $17,000 after one its rivals crashed. Bitcoin’s price was $20,946 on Friday morning, up nearly 1%. Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, said the Chapter 11 move by Genesis had been priced in by crypto markets. “The industry has already discounted the insolvency of Genesis. It won’t halt the bitcoin bull run. Ordinary investors have been very scared by recent events in crypto markets. But when they see prices trending again, they will reinvest in crypto – thereby also providing fees to crypto institutions –believing it is safe to do so.”","publicationTime":1674217481.000000000,"title":"Crypto lender Genesis files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in US","id":"business/2023/jan/20/crypto-lender-genesis-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy"},{"body":"I should be honest and say that any storyline involving bitcoin tends to send me to sleep quicker than a hot toddy with a Nytol chaser. Not only is it hard to make cryptocurrency look good on screen, or look like anything at all in fact, but its value is fluctuating so fast in real life that any sense of its worth is hard to gauge. Luckily, Romantic Getaway (Sky Comedy) has the decency to acknowledge at least the first part of the problem. “Get it out, I want to see what 50 grand looks like,” says Allison (Katherine Ryan). “There you go,” says her husband, Deacon (Romesh Ranganathan), slapping a promotional USB stick on the car dashboard. Ranganathan co-wrote Romantic Getaway with his longtime collaborator, Benjamin Green, and although it sounds like a title that came before a storyline, there is plenty of storyline on display. Allison and Deacon have been trying to have a baby, but after a miscarriage, they have been told that their hopes of conceiving are slim, even with medical intervention. Their last roll of the dice would be IVF treatment at a top-end clinic, with all the costs that private medical care would incur. It is unfair that such a life-changing service is only available to those who can afford it, and it galvanises the couple into making a rash decision. After admitting to each other that they are desperate enough for the chance of a baby to do pretty much anything, they set about “borrowing” – or rather, fleecing – money out of the property management company where they both work, by transferring the funds out of some forgotten accounts and into Deacon’s bitcoin wallet. Their boss is Alfie, a pinstripe-suited skinflint who rages about Wagon Wheels being put through on expenses and denies Allison and Deacon their rightful bonuses, but who will happily put afternoon “massages” and £300 bottles of vodka on the company card. Johnny Vegas is delightfully repulsive in the role of Alfie, alternately idiotic and threatening, depending on what time of the evening you catch him. So far, so heist. But at the last minute, Deacon, enraged by his employer and the injustice of life on a middling wage in a nondescript office block in Berkshire, decides to do something out of character and stick it to the man by adding an extra zero to the transfer. Soon, the couple’s deceit begins to spiral out of control. Deacon neglects to tell Allison about the extra £450k, while she starts to doubt whether she wants a baby at all. It’s a little bit romcom and a little bit thriller, and there are plenty of references to Bonnie and Clyde and even Robin Hood, though whether stealing bitcoin from a sauna-loving tight-arse to buy a new Prada handbag has quite the same appeal as robbing the rich to feed the poor remains to be seen. The use of IVF as the jumping-off point for a comedy caper is debatable, too. But it works well, even in its occasional emotional moments, thanks to the calibre of its cast. It leans heavily on the appeal of its two funny leads. Ryan and Ranganathan are better known as themselves than as actors, though both have previous sitcom experience, in The Duchess and Avoidance respectively. Each leans into their standup comedy persona for their characters here. Allison is bawdy and blunt, particularly when it comes to sex. When she says she is “very difficult to upset”, it reminds me of Ryan talking to Louis Theroux in November, in that great and revealing interview. Deacon, meanwhile, is anxious and dry and reckless in all the wrong places. This is a man who is overconfident about his ability to park in a tight space. There are moments at which Romantic Getaway feels as if it could have been a comedy or a drama, depending on the toss of a coin. But they plumped for comedy, and comedy it is. Once it gets the scene-setting out of the way, and establishes that they are sort-of-good people doing a bad thing for the right reasons, it starts to find its feet. As the tension rises, so too does the daftness. It is best when it is silliest, and Vegas, Ranganathan and Ryan make a surprisingly killer trio.","publicationTime":1672608605.000000000,"title":"Romantic Getaway review – Katherine Ryan and Romesh Ranganathan are brilliant in IVF heist caper","id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jan/01/romantic-getaway-review-katherine-ryan-and-romesh-ranganathan-are-brilliant-in-ivf-heist-caper"},{"body":"Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The mysterious inventor of bitcoin is a renowned figure in the world of cryptocurrency but his true identity is unknown. However, the British blogger Peter McCormack was certain about one thing: the answer isn’t Craig Wright. For years Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has claimed that he is Satoshi, the pseudonymous author of the 2008 white paper behind bitcoin. Wright’s assertion that he is the inventor of the digital asset – he first sought to prove that he is Satoshi in 2016, months after his name first emerged – has led to a series of legal tussles, some of which are continuing. One of them came to a pyrrhic conclusion in London this week, when McCormack was found to have caused serious harm to Wright’s reputation by repeatedly claiming that he is a fraud and is not Satoshi. But Wright, 52, won nominal damages of £1 after a high court judge ruled that he had given “deliberately false evidence” to support his libel claim. For cost reasons, McCormack did not offer a defence of truth – where the defendant in the case attempts to show that the allegations are substantially true – as Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled that one claim made in a video discussion on YouTube was defamatory, while a series of tweets repeating the fraud claims were ruled to have caused serious harm to Wright’s reputation. “Because he [Wright] advanced a deliberately false case and put forward deliberately false evidence until days before trial, he will recover only nominal damages,” wrote the judge. McCormack’s defence, shifted to a much narrower footing, was that the video and the tweets did not cause serious harm to Wright’s reputation. Wright claimed that his reputation had been seriously harmed by the tweets because he had been disinvited from 10 conferences, which meant that academic papers due to be presented at those events had not been published. McCormack submitted evidence from conference organisers who challenged Wright’s claims. Those claims were then dropped from Wright’s case at the trial in May. The judge was scathing. He said: “Dr Wright’s original case on serious harm, and the evidence supporting it, both of which were maintained until days before trial, were deliberately false.” Wright, who lives in Surrey and is the chief scientist at the blockchain technology firm nChain, said he had brought the case “not for financial reward, but for the principle and to get others to think twice before seeking to impugn my reputation”. And the legal cases continue to pile up. Wright has other high court cases pending. He has brought a libel case against a Norwegian Twitter user, Marcus Granath, who has also accused the Australian of being a fraud. Granath recently failed in an attempt to have the case thrown out. Wright is also suing two cryptocurrency exchanges in a case that argues that a digital asset called Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), which he backs, is the true descendant of the white paper. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (Copa), a non-profit that supports cryptocurrencies, is seeking a high court declaration that Wright is not the author of the white paper. Its case claims that Wright forged evidence produced to support his assertion that he is Satoshi. Wright, who denies Copa’s claims, failed in an attempt to have the case struck out last year. There was more legal back and forth before that. In 2020, Wright lost an attempt to sue Roger Ver, an early bitcoin backer, for calling Wright a fraud on YouTube after a judge ruled that the appropriate jurisdiction for a lawsuit would be the US. One year later, Wright won a copyright infringement claim against the anonymous operator and publisher of the bitcoin.org website for publishing the white paper. Wright won by default after bitcoin.org’s publisher, who goes by the pseudonym of Cobra, declined to speak in their defence. In the US, Wright won a case in December that spared him having to pay out a multibillion-dollar sum in bitcoins to the family of David Kleiman, a former business partner. Kleiman’s family had claimed that he was a co-creator of bitcoin along with Wright and they were therefore owed half of the 1.1m bitcoins “mined” by Satoshi. The case was closely watched in the expectation that if Wright lost he would have had to move those bitcoins – seen as the sword-in-the-stone test that would prove Satoshi’s true identity. Those coins are now worth $25bn (£21bn) at the current price of about $23,000 and sit on the bitcoin blockchain, a decentralised ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. Satoshi published the cryptocurrency’s foundation text – Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System – on 31 October 2008 and communicated by email with the currency’s first adherents before disappearing in 2011. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at University of Sussex business school, says Wright could prove that he is Satoshi by using the so-called private keys – a secure code comprising a hexadecimal string of numbers and letters – that will unlock access to the bitcoins. “The only way that Wright could prove he is SN would be to make a transaction with some of the original bitcoin,” she said. Wright is adamant that he will not do this, saying private keys do not prove ownership or identity. There are few other Satoshi candidates. In 2014, a Japanese-American man, Dorian S Nakamoto, was named by Newsweek as the creator of bitcoin and promptly denied any link to the digital currency. More informed speculation has centred on Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist who designed BitGold, viewed as a conceptual precursor to bitcoin. But he too has denied claims that he might be Satoshi. In the meantime, Mr Justice Chamberlain left open a question that remains unanswered. “The identity of Satoshi is not among the issues I have to determine,” he said.","publicationTime":1659776411.000000000,"title":"Another court case fails to unlock the mystery of bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto","id":"technology/2022/aug/06/another-court-case-fails-to-unlock-the-mystery-of-bitcoins-satoshi-nakamoto"},{"body":"The questions 1 Three-year-old Eliza Armstrong was the first patient at which hospital? 2 What is the world’s largest trade book fair? 3 Marduk was the chief god of which city? 4 Which songwriter was musical director for Marlene Dietrich? 5 Which three countries border both Russia and China? 6 Hakuhō Shō is considered the greatest ever competitor in which sport? 7 Where is England’s only statue of Bonnie Prince Charlie? 8 How is the boss of Stratton Oakmont described in a film title?

The software upgrade, known as “the merge”, will change how transactions are managed on the ethereum blockchain, a public and decentralised ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency and generates ether tokens, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s inventor, announced the completion of the plan on Twitter on Thursday morning, tweeting “Happy merge all”. The move means that ethereum will no longer be created by an energy intensive process known as “mining”, where banks of computers generate random numbers that validate transactions on the blockchain and generate new ether tokens as part of the process. The process, known as “proof of work” in the cryptocurrency world, will now move to a “proof of stake” system, where individuals and companies act as validators, pledging or “staking” their own ether as a form of guarantee, to win newly created tokens. Ethereum mining used up as much electricity as Austria, according to the Digiconomist website, at 72 terawatt-hours a year. Alex de Vries, the economist behind the website, estimates that the merge will reduce the carbon emissions linked to ethereum by more than 99%. De Vries added that the move could represent 0.2% of the world’s electricity consumption disappearing overnight. However, he said bitcoin remained the biggest single contributor to the crypto world’s carbon footprint. “All eyes will be on bitcoin. It remains the largest polluter in the crypto space. Even today bitcoin is responsible for as much electricity consumption as Sweden. And we know that’s not going to change,” said De Vries. Ethereum rose 2% to $1,630 (£1,417) after the move, according to website coinmarketcap, valuing the currency at just under $200bn. Bitcoin’s market cap is worth $387bn, having fallen sharply from its peak of more than $1tn last year. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at University of Sussex Business School, said the merge was a significant event for the crypto industry “The merge is the most important event in blockchain history,” she said. “In my opinion, today marks the beginning of the end of bitcoin’s dominance over crypto assets. Ethereum is achieving something that bitcoin never could because bitcoin is a purely speculative asset and its mining network would never agree to drop that source of income.” Alexander added that the ethereum blockchain is a key feature of the web3 world - a catch-all term for the latest iteration of the internet - including its role as a base for non-fungible tokens. “It powers the smart contract transactions on Ethereum that underpin web3 and therefore the digital economy today.”","publicationTime":1663234073.000000000,"title":"Ethereum cryptocurrency completes move to cut CO2 output by 99%","id":"technology/2022/sep/15/ethereum-cryptocurrency-completes-move-to-cut-co2-output-by-99"},{"body":"I’ve been writing about cryptocurrency for my entire career. In that time, one point I’ve always stuck to is simple: don’t listen to me for investment advice. Today, I want to quantify why. Bitcoin was created in 2009, while I was in my first year at university. As an economics student – and massive nerd – it sat squarely at the intersection of my interests. By my final year of uni in 2011, the original cryptocurrency was experiencing its first boom and bust cycle. It rose from a low of $0.30 to a high of $32.34 that summer, before crashing back down to less than $3 when Mt. Gox, the original bitcoin exchange, was hacked. (This will become a theme.) That was also the year the Guardian first covered the currency, with Ruth Whippman warning: “Its critics in the political sphere fear that it could give rise to an online Wild West of gambling, prostitution and global bazaars for contraband.” I was very much on the outside looking in, though. Not being a regular drug user (cf “massive nerd”), the mainstream use of bitcoin – getting pills or weed delivered by post from the Silk Road – passed me by, so I found it more of an intellectual curiosity than anything else. This is perhaps in part because the first thing I remember hearing about bitcoin was a tale, probably apocryphal, of someone using their gaming PC to mine the currency in their dorm room in a heatwave. The air conditioning failed, the user reported in a forum post, and heatstroke left them with mild brain damage. You can see why I was unimpressed. By the second major boom, I was covering economics for the New Statesman. And that’s where the trouble starts. In my first published piece using the word “bitcoin” – the first time the New Statesman had covered the topic – I confidently declared: “This is what a bubble looks like.” At the time, bitcoin was trading at around $40 a coin. It has never gotten that low again. I was right that there was a bubble in the offing: the price of bitcoin had doubled in two months, and would double twice more before it popped less than a month later. But the crash, which would have been huge for any other normal asset, was a reduction of around half, taking bitcoin to the lows of … three weeks prior. A decade on, the memory of this bold claim still haunts me, and I refuse to make predictions about the future of any cryptocurrency. In fact, I’ve taken to joking that the best way to make money, historically, is to do the opposite of what I say. So I put it to the test. The Alex Hern bitcoin investment strategy Obviously, I don’t give actual investment advice. So I reviewed every article I’ve ever written that mentions “bitcoin”, and sorted them based on whether or not a reader would think they were good news for the crypto, or bad news. There’s an element of value judgment to this, of course: you might disagree with my decision that a story about the Winklevii launching a bitcoin price tracker in 2014 is broadly positive; or that a story about Mt. Gox reopening after a hack (another hack) is broadly negative. My hope is that the disagreements average out. Then, I paired the stories against the price of bitcoin on the day they were written, and asked a simple question: if you’d bought $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like bad news, and sold $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like good news, how would your investment have performed? The bottom line: you would have spent a net of $420 on bitcoin, and have a crypto wallet containing around 1.1 bitcoin as a result – worth, at today’s market value, a little over $22,000. Oof. Going over the specifics, though, gives me a bit of cheer. Well over half that gain comes from a total of just seven pieces written in 2013: six negative and one positive. At the end of that run, you’d have spent $50, and own 0.7 bitcoin. Those articles have an outsized influence on the over-calculation, due to how much bitcoin’s value has increased in the nine years since they were published. Bitcoin had two boom and bust cycles in 2013. The first, in April, took it to a high of $266. The second, in December was bigger – much bigger. The price of a coin spiked at $1,238, and fell to a low of $687. The rush of pieces I wrote about the currency when I started at the Guardian, through late 2013 and the first half of 2014, contribute much less to the bottom line, even though there were more of them. It was also the period with the most positive stories for bitcoin. In 2014, the potential of the currency was still untapped: the idea that bitcoin or the blockchain might prove revolutionary wasn’t a hackneyed promise, but something that might be just around the corner. In that boom, I wrote as many positive stories as negative. For every article about bitcoin hitting an “all-time high” of $269, there was another about a £1m hack of a payment processor. For every long feature asking if bitcoin was about to change the world, there was a warning from a Dutch central banker that the hype was “worse than tulip mania” (and he should know). The timing of the pieces didn’t quite balance out, though, and by the end of that boom you would have turned your 0.7 bitcoin into 0.9 while cashing out as many dollars as you put in. And in that period, those bitcoin would have gone from $100 to more than $500. From 2014 to the most recent boom, however, the money you put in would start being drowned out by the bitcoin you already own. $10 at the beginning of 2014 bought you around 0.01 bitcoin, and so 10 negative pieces from me would have sizeably increased your position. Three years later, it would take 30 negative pieces for you to acquire the same amount of bitcoin. That meant the impact of the ICO boom – the first of the great expansions of the sector from a handful of cryptocurrencies to a whole ecosystem of shitcoins – was muted compared to what came before, despite stories about Iceland becoming a miner’s paradise and Kodak bringing out a branded cryptominer, leading to a flurry of buying and selling. And three years after that, at the beginning of 2020, a $10 investment in the cryptocurrency would get you just 0.001 BTC. That’s good news for our theoretical investor, because 2020 marked my most positive reporting on the currency. Stories such as the US government seizing bitcoins used in the Silk Road were a sign of the growing professionalism of the sector and, for the first time, bitcoin was enough of a fixture of the tech scene that even in a comparative slump the Guardian was still covering it. On to the latest boom and bust cycle, where – finally – the investor starts to lose out and I claw back some of my reputation. From its peak at $69,000 earlier this year, bitcoin has fallen by a third. I’ve diligently covered the collapse, which has been by far the most brutal the sector has faced. That means the tracker has sunk almost $200 into bitcoin, and even as the overall value of the holdings has plummeted from a high of $50,000 in March to its present number. What next? The question going forward, of course, is whether the pattern holds up. Will you continue to make money if you buy when I’m grumpy about crypto, and sell when I’m optimistic? Obviously – see above – I’m not about to make any strong predictions, but I doubt we’ll ever again see as sharp an increase in price as we saw in the last decade, which means I’ll never make a call that plays out as badly as the ones in those initial pieces from 2013. Which is not to say I can’t make other terrible calls. Remember Dejitaru Tsuka, the shitcoin that was sold with my name? I broke my rules, and warned readers: “I do not think you should buy this shitcoin, nor any others.” Well, if you’d bought £10 worth of Tsuka when I said that, you’d now have … £4,000.

Here’s why","id":"technology/2022/aug/03/techscape-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-predictions"},{"body":"Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, has completed a plan to drastically reduce its carbon emissions through a software upgrade known as “the merge”. Here we explain what has changed and what the implications might be. What is ‘the merge’? It is the name given to a significant change in the security system that underpins the ethereum blockchain, the second most important piece of infrastructure in the entire cryptocurrency space. Until Thursday, ethereum used a system called “proof of work” to determine the validity of transactions on its blockchain and ensure everyone in the community had consensus about who owned what cryptocurrency. But in the background, the community has also been experimenting with another system, called “proof of stake”, running a parallel network using that instead of proof of work. Those two networks are what merged on Thursday: there is now only one network, and everyone on it is relying on proof of stake. What does it actually change? The electricity footprint of ethereum should fall from around 8.5GW to less than 85MW, almost overnight. For comparison, Hornsea Two, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, generates 1.4GW of electricity. That enormous reduction is because of the fundamental difference between proof of work and proof of stake. In the former, ethereum “miners” competed to burn the most electricity and computing power possible, with the winner awarded a cash prize and the right to validate the previous 10 minutes of transactions. That successfully made the system very expensive to attack, since any malicious miner would have to buy more energy and chips than the entire rest of the network combined – but also made it incredibly wasteful. Proof of stake, by contrast, awards the right to validate transactions to the users with the most ethereum “staked” – that is, locked up within the system. Attacking the network as a whole is still expensive, but only because an attacker would have to buy more ethereum than the rest of the stakers combined. Does this mean ethereum is zero-carbon now? Not quite. The underlying aim of ethereum has always been to operate as a “world computer”, letting users write programs that can be run “on the blockchain”. That is the innovation that allowed creations like smart contracts, NFTs and decentralised finance to be built but it is also a very inefficient way to run programs compared with conventional “centralised” approaches. The 85MW that the ethereum blockchain will continue to use after the merge is low compared with 8.5GW, but high compared with other ways of providing the same amount of computing power: one Raspberry Pi, a £30 credit-card sized computer, runs at 15W and has about 5,000 times the computing power of the ethereum blockchain. Much of the electricity powering the computers of ethereum “stakers” will come from zero-carbon sources, but by no means all. Can I buy NFTs with a clean conscience? Yes – at least when it comes to the environmental impact. Almost all NFTs are built on one of a small number of blockchains, overwhelmingly ethereum or its competitors telos or stellar, which now use proof of stake. That means that the carbon impact of buying an NFT, once comparable to taking a transatlantic flight, has been slashed. Of course the lower carbon impact has no impact on whether or not buying an NFT is a good idea. What about bitcoin? The $387m question. The original cryptocurrency, which still accounts for about a third of the value of the entire sector, is unlikely to ever switch away from proof of work. Its electrical footprint stands at about 15GW, even after the enormous crash in prices this year, and the network as a whole emits the same CO2 as the entire nation of Austria, according to Digiconomist. But bitcoin is defined by its conservatism. The cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, famously disappeared without a trace shortly after it began to take off, and without the founder’s blessing, every attempt to push through significant changes to the structure of the network has failed. Bitcoin “forks” with names such as Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Classic have all tried and failed to succeed in replacing the original flavour of the currency, and the bitcoin community is rallying around proof of work, arguing that it remains the only proven way of securing a cryptocurrency at scale.","publicationTime":1663240820.000000000,"title":"How does ethereum’s ‘merge’ make the cryptocurrency greener?","id":"technology/2022/sep/15/price-carbon-emissions-ethereum-merge-make-cryptocurrency-greener"},{"body":"The Bank of England has said that bitcoin could be “worthless” and people investing in the digital currency should be prepared to lose everything. In a warning over the potential risks for investors, the central bank questioned whether there was any inherent worth in the most prominent digital currency, which has soared in value this year to close to $50,000 (£37,786) a piece. The cryptocurrency peaked above $67,000 in early November, but suffered a sell-off after news first broke of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, before stabilising around its current level in the past week. The deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said the Bank had to be ready for risks linked to the rise of the crypto asset following rapid growth in its popularity. “Their price can vary quite considerably and [bitcoins] could theoretically or practically drop to zero,” he told the BBC. The market capitalisation of crypto assets has grown tenfold since early 2020 to about $2.6tn, representing about 1% of global financial assets. About 0.1% of UK households’ wealth is in bitcoin and similar crypto assets, such as ethereum and Binance coin. As many as 2.3 million people hold crypto assets, at an average amount of about £300 each. The Bank’s financial policy committee, set up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to monitor risks, said on Monday there was little direct threat to the stability of the UK financial system from crypto assets. However, it warned that, at the current rapid pace of growth, such assets could become more interconnected with traditional financial services and were likely to pose a number of risks. Publishing its regular health check on the financial system, the Bank said major institutions should take a cautious approach to adopting crypto assets and that it would pay close attention to developments in the market. “Enhanced regulatory and law enforcement frameworks, both domestically and at a global level, are needed to influence developments in these fast-growing markets in order to manage risks, encourage sustainable innovation and maintain broader trust and integrity in the financial system,” it said. In a separate blogpost published on its website on Tuesday, a member of the Bank’s staff said bitcoin failed to fulfil many of the features required of a currency and that it risked being inherently volatile. Thomas Belsham, who works in the Bank’s stakeholder and media engagement division, wrote: “The problem is that, unlike traditional forms of money, Bitcoin isn’t used to price things other than itself. As Bitcoiners themselves are fond of saying, ‘one Bitcoin = one Bitcoin’. But a tautology does not a currency make.” He said scarcity of the crypto asset – which is limited to 21m bitcoin – is among the key reasons for its attraction for investors, but this feature embedded into its design “may even, ultimately, render Bitcoin worthless”. About 19m bitcoin is currently in circulation, with new coins added when “miners” validate changes to the blockchain ledger underpinning the cryptocurrency. While the ultimate number of bitcoin in circulation is not expected to be reached until February 2140, it would become harder to sustain this system over time, Belsham said. “Simple game theory tells us that a process of backward induction should, really, at some point, induce the smart money to get out. And were that to happen, investors really should be prepared to lose everything. Eventually.”","publicationTime":1639505913.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin could become ‘worthless’, Bank of England warns","id":"technology/2021/dec/14/bitcoin-could-become-worthless-bank-of-england-warns"},{"body":"On Monday, after months of discussions, threats and warnings, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took aim at the most powerful force in the world of cryptocurrencies. The US financial watchdog accused the crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao of operating a “web of deception,” charging him and his exchange with 13 offences. Binance handles billions in investments for many everyday investors, but the effects are likely to stretch far beyond the cloistered, online world of crypto. The company sponsors the Italian football team Lazio and the Argentina national team. It also sponsored the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations tournament. It has also extended its interests with venture capital investments as well as a $500m stake in Elon Musk’s Twitter. The SEC appears bent on a wider crypto crackdown, prompted by the collapse last year of the Bahamas-based FTX, whose founder, the US national Sam Bankman-Fried, has now been charged with securities fraud, money laundering and other offences. On Tuesday, the SEC accused another crypto platform, Coinbase, of putting customers at risk by operating as an “unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency”. What is Binance? Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Through its online platform, the company offers simplified avenues for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, in exchange for small fees. Binance dominates crypto trading. Last year its trades accounted for up to 70% of the market, with billions of dollars pumped through the exchange every day. As the company has faced a tougher regulatory environment, its share of the market has fallen – but it still accounts for around 50% of the monthly crypto exchange volume. In 2019, Binance was facing a regulatory crackdown in the US over a number of potential violations. In response, it restricted access to its main exchange –Binance.com – in the US and launched a new business: Binance.US. Binance.US offered fewer crypto and digital assets than its parent company – but crucially, it was billed as an entirely separate exchange that was run independent of Binance.com. Binance.US would be subject to US regulations and therefore be able to operate legally within the country. What is Binance and its founder accused of? Among the central allegations from the SEC is that Binance and Zhao failed to truly split the US company from the US exchange that it was spun off from. Binance.US says that, from 2019, its customers were restricted from transacting on Binance.com. However, the SEC alleges that in reality, Binance and Zhao “subverted their own controls to secretly allow high-value US customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform”. The SEC alleges that, while Binance publicly claimed that Binance.US was a separate, independent trading platform for US investors, Zhao secretly controlled the US company behind the scenes. Among the products that Binance.US is alleged to have illegally offered its US customers are commodity derivatives – which effectively place a bet on the price of a cryptocurrency rather than buying it directly. Another US regulator filed a lawsuit in March claiming that Binance had been offering these services since July 2019, despite not being registered with the derivatives markets regulator. The SEC complaint includes evidence that the Binance leadership were aware that they were contravening US regulations. A message from the Binance chief compliance officer to a colleague, included in the evidence in the lawsuit, reads: “We are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.” The SEC alleges that assets were diverted to a separate entity, owned and controlled by Zhao, called Sigma Chain. This was used for so-called “wash-trading”, in which a trader buys and sells the same asset between their own accounts, in order to give the “artificial appearance of” increased trading volume. Through this practice, the SEC alleges that Zhao was able to inflate the Binance.US trading volume. What does Binance say? Binance says that it has actively cooperated with the SEC since the start of its investigation and and “respectfully disagrees” with the allegations. “We intend to defend our platform vigorously,” the company said in a blogpost, but added that “because Binance is not a US exchange, the SEC’s actions are limited in reach”. “As with other crypto projects facing similar suits, the Commission has determined to regulate with the blunt weapons of enforcement and litigation rather than the thoughtful, nuanced approach demanded by this dynamic and complex technology,” Binance said. The company added that “any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong.” How significant is this? News of the SEC charges sent the price of bitcoin – the largest and most commonly traded crypto asset – to its lowest point in almost three months. When rival exchange FTX collapsed last year, the price of bitcoin fell by close to 25% in a matter of days. There is no sign that Binance is close to any sort of collapse – and the company has sought to calm its customer and curb a sudden withdrawal of deposits by saying that “all user assets on Binance and Binance affiliate platforms, including Binance.US, are safe and secure”.. Known as “CZ”, Zhao is one of the most prominent leaders in the crypto sector – particularly after the fall of his rival, Bankman-Fried. Is it part of a broader crackdown? On Tuesday, the SEC announced a new set of charges, this time targeting Coinbase, the US-domiciled crypto exchange that has long marketed itself as the most respectable crypto exchange. Not so, argued the regulator, which has accused Coinbase of operating an unlicensed securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency, putting customers at risk in the process. The pair of enforcement actions suggest the SEC has decided to take broad aim at cryptocurrency firms it sees as bypassing regulation, either by blurring the distinction between on- and offshore services, as with its allegations against Binance, or by trading unregulated securities, as it alleges Coinbase has done. At the heart of the issue is a more fundamental question: are cryptocurrencies something truly new, which needs a unique regulatory regime, or are they simply digital versions of pre-existing financial instruments which the SEC already regulates? The agency believes that a good portion of the industry is the latter, and is seeking to ensure that crypto companies either comply, or stop operating in the US. What now for crypto? The sector, already bruised by the collapse of FTX, is firmly in the midst of a “crypto winter”, with investment drying up and regulators preparing to pounce. The SEC’s interpretation of US law is potentially damaging for a broad swathe of the industry, and could prompt companies to move elsewhere, but regulatory havens are increasingly few and far between. In the UK, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has historically been a supporter of the sector, using his time at the Treasury to command the Royal Mint to make and sell a collectible “NFT” and pushing the Bank of England to issue guidance on stablecoins and “central bank digital currencies”. But in recent months, the UK has discussed introducing stricter rules itself, as Sunak’s attention has turned to AI: a May report from MPs called on cryptocurrencies to be regulated as a form of gambling.","publicationTime":1686072189.000000000,"title":"SEC crypto crackdown: US regulator sues Binance and Coinbase","id":"technology/2023/jun/06/sec-crypto-crackdown-us-regulator-sues-binance-and-coinbase"},{"body":"Environmentalists in Montana called it the “death watch”. Following years of financial losses one of the handful of remaining coal-fired power plants in the state appeared doomed, its likely fate offering a small but noteworthy victory in the effort to avoid disastrous climate change. But then a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it. The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “We were just waiting for this thing to die,” said Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “They were struggling and looking to close. It was on the brink. And then this cryptocurrency company came along.” In a deal struck in late 2020, Marathon, a bitcoin “mining” company, became the sole recipient of the power station’s electricity. It established an elongated data center on 20 acres of land beside the facility that is packed with more than 30,000 Antminer S19 units, a specialized computer that mines for bitcoin. Such thirst for power is common in crypto – globally bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway, a country of 5.3 million people. As the bitcoin miners moved in last year, Hardin roared back to life. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, the plant’s boilers fired up on 236 separate days. Planet-heating emissions from the burning of Hardin’s coal soared too, with 187,000 tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the second quarter of last year, more than 5000% more than was expelled in the same period in 2020. In the third quarter, a further 206,000 tons of CO2 was emitted, a 905% increase on 2020, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows. Hardin was operating at “near full capacity”, Marathon said in a December update, with the data center producing around 34 bitcoin on 1 December. “I was horrified to see it all happen, it was a terrible turn of events,” said Hedges, who took to visiting the plant and photographing the new data center as it took shape, fans perched on its roof to help cool the humming computer hardware. “This isn’t helping old ladies from freezing to death, it’s to enrich a few people while destroying our climate for all of us. If you’re concerned about climate change you should have nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it’s a disaster for the climate.” Hardin is part of a wave of America’s “zombie” fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations. China, formerly the epicenter of the bitcoin industry, effectively banished around half of the world’s currency miners last year and the resulting search for cheap power has seen companies eye struggling US power stations. In 2020, a mothballed coal plant in upstate New York was converted to run on gas and power a large-scale bitcoin mining operation, a move that owner Greenidge Generation said is “bringing a piece of the world’s digital future” to the state. Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor who said he would accept his first paycheck in bitcoin, last week criticised the environmental impact of crypto mining. Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close before pivoting to bitcoin. And in Kentucky, a new bitcoin facility is being built next to the Big Rivers Electric Corporation, which owns and operates four coal-fired power plants. This tactic, crypto firms argue, generates local jobs – Kentucky aimed to lure currency miners by passing a law that exempts them from an electricity sales tax – and uses up excess power without straining the grid for homes and businesses. But critics point out that the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US. “Coal and natural gas power plants used for crypto mining that would otherwise be sunsetting as we decarbonize adds yet more carbon to the atmosphere in an era when we should be cutting such emissions,” said Benjamin Jones, a specialist in natural resource economics at the University of New Mexico. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.” Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm. Even some early champions of bitcoin have balked at its energy use, with Elon Musk last year halting Tesla’s use of the crypto currency because, he said, the electric vehicle company is “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Uber, the ride-hailing service, has said it won’t accept crypto payments until the climate impacts are reduced. A little more than a decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoins with a single computer at home, using a negligible amount of electricity. The ultimate supply of bitcoins was limited and new bitcoins were awarded to those who could help validate transactions – the miners. The process of validation essentially involves playing a giant guessing game that gets more difficult the more miners participate. As interest in bitcoin has soared, fast, powerful computers, packed in warehouses, now have a better chance of winning the guessing game and being rewarded with several bitcoins, which are currently worth around $42,000 each. This race for bitcoin wealth gobbles up an enormous amount of electricity – around 0.5% of total global consumption. The energy used to mine bitcoin every 60 seconds would be enough to power the average American household for 17 years, while the annual electricity consumption for mining would be able to power all kettles used to boil water for tea in the UK for 28 years. While this usage has been criticized by climate activists, bitcoin miners claim it should be put in a different context. Fred Thiel, chief executive of Marathon, said that the movement of physical goods around the world, and even the use of washing machines in the US, uses more energy than bitcoin. “I understand the desire for some people to point bitcoin mining as the big bad boy, but on a comparison with every other industry out there, it’s insignificant,” he said in an interview. Thiel likens bitcoin mining to the transactions processed in data centers by companies such as Amazon and Google and claimed that the industry is moving quickly towards renewable energy – Marathon plans to phase out its use of coal next year – after finding its options were limited when miners had to quickly shift away from China. “Go back to 2020, renewable companies weren’t offering energy to bitcoin miners,” said Thiel. “Very few people wanted to even deal with bitcoin miners in the energy world. And so bitcoin miners spent time looking for stranded assets. And so the only way for us to mine was to find stranded energy, which we did in finding the Hardin plant.” It remains to be seen if bitcoin will make a significant move away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime it will likely come under increasing scrutiny over its appetite for fossil fuel-powered electricity. “We simply don’t know how emissions from bitcoin mining will look in five to 10 years,” said Jones, the University of New Mexico professor. “It seems likely, though, it will to continue to be a major consumer of energy going forward.”","publicationTime":1645182003.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin miners revived a dying coal plant – then CO2 emissions soared","id":"technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared"},{"body":"The City watchdog and local police have raided several sites in east London suspected of housing illegal ATMs distributing cryptocurrencies, as part of a widening crackdown on the sector. The joint operation between the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Metropolitan police came just weeks after similar raids in Leeds. Those are believed to be the first to target crypto distribution in the UK, including machines that allow customers to buy or convert traditional currencies into cryptoassets such as bitcoin. The FCA said it would review evidence it had collected during those operations and would “consider taking further action where necessary”. While the FCA does not regulate the sector, it does require all firms dealing in crypto to register and prove they have effective anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls. There are no crypto ATMs registered with the FCA, meaning any operating in the UK are doing so illegally. Mark Steward, the director in charge of enforcement and market oversight at the City regulator, said the raids were sending “a clear message” that authorities were continuing to search for and target unregistered crypto businesses across the UK. “Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal and, as today shows, we will take action to stop this,” Steward said. The FCA said it was working with the National Economic Crime Centre to plan and coordinate with other law enforcement partners – following its work with the Met and West Yorkshire police – to find and shut down unregistered crypto ATMs. “Crypto products are not currently regulated and they are high risk. You should be prepared to lose all your money if you invest in them,” the regulator added.","publicationTime":1678278148.000000000,"title":"City regulator joins Met in raids on suspected crypto ATM operations","id":"technology/2023/mar/08/city-regulator-met-raids-suspected-crypto-atm-operations-police-london-leeds-crackdown-fca"},{"body":"In 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority was adamant: Binance is not capable of being regulated in the UK. Executives at the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange are not taking no for an answer. This month, Binance vowed to do “everything” it possibly could to change the City regulator’s mind, against a backdrop of deepening scepticism about digital assets. The collapse last year of one of Binance’s biggest rivals, FTX, and the criminal proceedings that have followed, tarnished the sector. Those concerns were underlined by parliament’s cross-party Treasury committeethis month, which said UK authorities should regulate cryptocurrency trading as a form of gambling – adding that digital assets such as bitcoin have “no intrinsic value”. The global markets watchdog, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), called for a different approach this week and said cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the same way as traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. There is also evidence elsewhere that tech firms face a scrupulous regulatory environment in the UK. Reports suggest Revolut, Britain’s most valuable fintech firm, could have its application for a banking licence rejected by the Bank of England after the company’s auditor, BDO, raised concerns about the balance sheet. Binance, which handles $65bn (£53bn) in daily trades and has no global headquarters, has been accepted by some oversight regimes but has been rejected by others. In the case of the US, the business is firmly in the sights of the authorities. On 10 May, the company’s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, bemoaned a crackdown in the US that he said had made it “very difficult” to do business in a key market. Recruited to the company in 2021, Hillman is familiar with the regulatory environment in Europe. He was formerly a senior figure at public relations firm Edelman where his specialisms included crisis management, and before that held a consultant role for the European Commission. He said Binance was going to do everything it could to be regulated in the UK, and described the EU’s recently agreed crypto-asset regulation, Mica, as a “huge step forward”. As part of any UK process, Binance will need to register with the FCA, which requires crypto-exchanges to prove they have systems in place to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. The regulator said it did not comment on specific companies but its official position on Binance had not changed since 2021, when it barred the business from regulated activity in the UK. At the time that FCA said the firm was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. It appears nothing has happened yet to change that view. The regulator’s 2021 supervisory notice referred to Binance’s ownership structure as “complex” and with an “extensive geographical spread”, factors that appeared to be “hindering the provision of adequate and reliable information to the FCA”. That opacity is still an issue, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator that oversees the market for derivatives (transactions that effectively place a bet on the price of a cryptocurrency rather than buying it directly). The CFTC sued Binance in March and described it as an “opaque web of corporate entities”. Citing an organisational chart featuring more than 120 entities incorporated in jurisdictions around the world, the regulator alleged: “Binance’s reliance on a maze of corporate entities to operate the Binance platform is deliberate; it is designed to obscure the ownership, control, and location.” At the time Binance said the complaint was “unexpected and disappointing” as it had already invested an additional $80m in ensuring it complied with regulators around the world. Nigel Brahams, a partner at the UK law firm Collyer Bristow, said Binance had the resources to deal with the FCA’s concerns. However, Binance would need to assemble a compliance team in the UK, he said. Brahams added: “The FCA requires firms that it authorises, or even those which are only subject to its crypto registration regime, to have sufficient infrastructure on the ground in the UK. If Binance wishes to operate their trading platform out of the UK, they would need to hire locally based support functions, the core of which would need to be money laundering and compliance.” Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, said regulating Binance would be a big challenge if the company sought authorisation for its full range of activities. This was because the company was a “multifunction organisation” that offered a range of products from broking to high-frequency derivatives trading, she added. “It is a massive ask for one country to take on the regulation of Binance,” Alexander said. “Even though the government plans to make the UK a global cryptoasset technology hub, the resources currently available fall very far short of what is needed.” So far, the demise of FTX in November has not hit the price of crypto. By one rule of thumb in the investment world, recent rises in interest rates should have made unconventional assets less attractive but so far this year the value of a bitcoin, the cornerstone crypto asset, is up 6o% to $26,440 as of Friday morning. It remains far below its peak of $69,000. Binance is licensed and registered by regulators in a number of jurisdictions including France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Japan. It also uses big names to push its brand, with its commercial partners including the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, Italy’s Lazio football team and TikTok megastar Khaby Lame. The US commodities regulator’s case against Binance, which has yet to go to court, alleges the company has taken a lax approach to internal controls. In one example, Binance’s former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim is quoted by the CFTC in a 2020 chat about certain customers, including some from Russia. Lim said: “Like come on. They are here for crime.” Binance’s money-laundering reporting officer agreed, saying: “We see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.” The US in particular has become a regulatory sceptic. This month Coinbase, another crypto exchange, issued pointed praise of the regulatory regime for digital assets in the United Arab Emirates. The US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned Coinbase in March that it was considering legal action against the company over possible violations of securities laws. Last month, the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, defended the watchdog’s tough stance on crypto regulation in an appearance before Washington lawmakers. Crypto-trading platforms and exchanges should comply with the law, he said, “and until they do, we will continue to pursue them as the cop on the beat”. Since 2022 the SEC has announced more than 30 cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. John Stark, a former SEC official and senior lecturing fellow at Duke University’s school of law, said the crackdown was driven by concerns over protecting consumers after the FTX collapse and the industry’s use of plausible investor jargon when offering services such as broking or exchanges. “Cryptocurrency is in the midst of a regulatory onslaught in the US. I have never before seen any SEC enforcement program this intense,” he said. A Binance spokesperson said the company had been “vocal” about the need for effective regulation of the industry, adding: “We strongly believe that a stable regulatory environment can support innovation and is essential to establishing trust in the industry and long-term growth. “Binance has invested heavily in a robust compliance programme that incorporates sophisticated anti-money laundering principles and tools used by traditional financial institutions to detect and address suspicious activity.” Further regulation is coming to the UK. In February, the Treasury published a consultation document on bringing crypto regulation in line with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds and that talked about balancing “risk as well as opportunity”. Any opportunity, if given, will come with enhanced scrutiny.","publicationTime":1685163612.000000000,"title":"‘It’s a massive ask’: is Binance capable of being regulated?","id":"technology/2023/may/27/is-binance-capable-of-being-regulated-crypto-exchange-uk"},{"body":"“Does everyone,” the film critic Anne Billson asked on Twitter, “have an evil jar in their fridge?” To which surely the correct answer is: “Only one?

It is estimated that more than 200,000 potential victims were targeted via the iSpoof fraud website, which was taken down this week by Scotland Yard’s cybercrime unit with the help of the authorities in the US and Ukraine. At one stage almost 20 people every minute of the day were being contacted by scammers hiding behind false identities created using the site and it is estimated that criminals may have stolen close to £50m. The actual amount is likely to be higher as fraud is often underreported. One victim was scammed out of £3m, while the average amount stolen was £10,000. Those running the scam shop made about £3.2m over a 20-month period, it is estimated. Fraudsters paid iSpoof, which was set up in December 2020, for a service that allowed them to disguise their phone number and pretend to be calling from a credible organisation, such as a bank or the tax office. The scammers used bitcoin to pay for the service. They would then trick people into handing over money or giving them access to their bank accounts. In the year to August around 10m fraudulent calls were made globally via iSpoof, with about 3.5m of those made in the UK. Of those, 350,000 calls lasted more than one minute and were made to 200,000 individuals. Users of the service, which was shut down this week, believed they were anonymous. However, that was not the case, and more than 100 people have been arrested as part of Operation Elaborate so far, predominantly in London. The arrests include the suspected mastermind behind the website, Teejai Fletcher, whom police described as living a “lavish” lifestyle. Fletcher, 34, of Western Gateway, east London, has been charged with making or supplying articles for use in fraud, participating in activities of an organised crime group and proceeds of crime matters on 7 November. He was remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Southwark crown court on 6 December. The Met, which led the operation, began investigating iSpoof in June 2021, working with international law enforcement agencies including those in the US, the Netherlands and Ukraine to close down the website. Investigators infiltrated the website – which had 59,000 users – and discovered 70m rows of data and bitcoin records, allowing them to begin to trace the suspects. As the pool of suspects is so large, the investigation is initially focused on UK users and those who spent at least 100 bitcoin to use the site. Det Supt Helen Rance, who leads on cybercrime for the Met, said: “By taking down iSpoof we have prevented further offences and stopped fraudsters targeting future victims. “Our message to criminals who have used this website is we have your details and are working hard to locate you, regardless of where you are.” Police have a list of phone numbers targeted by iSpoof fraudsters and will contact potential victims via text on Thursday and Friday. Any message received after 25 November was not from the police, it warned. The text message will ask victims to visit the Met’s website to provide more details about their experience. It will not include a clickable link. Anyone who is not contacted by the Met but believes they have been the victim of a number-spoofing scam should report the incident to Action Fraud. The police force said it plans to use the Proceeds of Crime Act to recoup the money where possible. The Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, said: “By taking away the tools and systems that have enabled fraudsters to cheat innocent people at scale, this operation shows how we are determined to target corrupt individuals intent on exploiting often vulnerable people.”","publicationTime":1669248072.000000000,"title":"100 people arrested in UK’s biggest fraud investigation","id":"money/2022/nov/24/100-people-arrested-ispoof-uk-biggest-investigation"},{"body":"A woman accused of laundering billions of dollars in stolen cryptocurrency alongside her husband may end up becoming better known for her excruciating music career as a self-styled “raunchy rapper” called Razzlekhan. Heather Morgan was arrested along with her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, in Manhattan on Tuesday over their alleged involvement in laundering bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack of the virtual currency exchange Bitfinex. They are not accused of involvement in the hack itself but face charges of conspiring to commit money laundering as well as to defraud the United States. However, the charges risk being overshadowed by Morgan’s portrayal of an apparently lavish lifestyle online as a “badass money maker” and performer. The 31-year-old has published an extensive catalogue of rap videos, DIY techniques and other lifestyle issues on social media platforms including Instagram and TikTok, calling herself the “Turkish Martha Stewart” or the “Waffle Queen of Korea”. On her website, Morgan calls herself Razzlekhan or the “Versace Bedouin … the raunchy rapper with more pizzazz than Genghis Khan”. “I’m a real risk taker/pirate riding the flood/I’m a badass money maker,” she raps in one video in which she refers to herself as the “Crocodile of Wall Street”. “Come real far but don’t know where I’m headed/Blindly following rules is for fools,” she says, gyrating on Wall Street wearing sunglasses, a leopard print scarf, and shiny gold jacket. Morgan, 31, was arrested along with her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, in Manhattan on Tuesday. The pair is accused of conspiring to launder 119,754 bitcoin stolen after a hacker broke into Bitfinex and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorised transactions. Justice department officials said the transactions at the time were valued at $71m in bitcoin, but with the rise in the currency’s value, it is now valued at over $4.5bn. Prosecutors claim the pair tried to launder money via a network of currency exchanges or claimed that the money represented payments to Morgan’s startup, the department said. Prosecutors said on Tuesday the illegal proceeds were spent on things ranging from gold and non-fungible tokens to “absolutely mundane things such as purchasing a Walmart gift card for $500”. At a bail hearing on Friday, a defence attorney called the charges “thin” and overblown. “I don’t think you’ll find that billions of dollars have been laundered,” he said. However, thanks to their ubiquitous social media presence, details about Morgan, from California, and Lichtenstein, a dual US-Russian national from Illinois also known as “Dutch”, have emerged since their arrest. “Her art often resembles something in between an acid trip and a delightful nightmare,” Morgan wrote about herself on her website, Razzlekhan.com. “Definitely not for the faint of heart or easily offended. “Razz likes to push the limits of what people are comfortable with,” she said. “Her style has often been described as ‘sexy horror comedy’.” The social media posts tout a lavish lifestyle. One video shows a glimpse of an upscale Manhattan apartment with a clear view of the sky and other buildings. In a Facebook post from October, Morgan hinted at wanting to buy a painting from Sotheby’s auction house. When not making rap videos or posting pictures of her artwork or a Bengal cat on Facebook, Morgan was a contributor to the financial publications Forbes and Inc. A June 2020 article she wrote for Forbes was titled: “Experts share tips to protect your business from cybercriminals.” More discreet online, Lichtenstein described himself on LinkedIn as a “technology entrepreneur, coder and investor” and the founder of several tech companies. In a Facebook post, he recalled how he proposed to Morgan – “my best friend and the woman of my dreams!” It involved what Lichtenstein called a “weird, creative multi-channel marketing campaign” that saw posters of Razzlekhan plastered across New York City and her face on a Times Square billboard. In one YouTube video, Morgan said: “I’ve also been totally broke and homeless multiple times … Money comes and goes. Sometimes you have it, sometimes you don’t. “It’s really nice when you have it but nothing in this life is certain,” she said. “Right now I’m basically living my ideal life.”","publicationTime":1644470977.000000000,"title":"‘Sexy horror comedy’: Bitcoin laundering suspect is also ‘raunchy rapper’ Razzlekhan","id":"technology/2022/feb/10/sexy-horror-comedy-bitcoin-laundering-suspect-is-also-raunchy-rapper-razzlekhan"},{"body":"Mia Mottley, once again, this time at Cop27, chastised the west for being the main culprits in the climate crisis. The Barbados prime minister said that the Caribbean and Pacific islands, being the most vulnerable and least responsible, face certain doom if wealthier nations are not held accountable. The Caribbean has some of the most resilient and talented people in the world. People who have risen above slavery, indentureship and colonialism. Over the past five decades they have faced corrupt politicians draining their economies, perennial climate disasters and economic discrimination by the west. Now, these small island developing states, still reeling from the Covid pandemic, face further economic challenges inflicted by banks from the US, the UK and EU and Australia. Academics and journalists have been writing about financial “de-risking” in the Caribbean region for at least a decade, and how it has been getting worse over that time. Simply put, de-risking is where foreign banks perceive that the risks of doing business in a region outweigh the rewards. Mottley has been highlighting the issue this year, telling the US Congress that de-risking is the “most nonsensical thing” the region has “seen in public policy” and that it will lead to the very money laundering and financing of terrorism that the US and Caribbean governments want to avoid. But little has improved: banks continue to leave the Caribbean. That makes international trade increasingly difficult, not just for local companies but for foreign corporations and individuals wanting to do business in the region or simply to extend financial support to their families. Sustaining trade has been increasingly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses. The fallout from de-risking is significant – stagnated economic growth in nations already reeling from Covid and the hurricanes and flooding worsened by the climate crisis. It has discouraged foreign direct investment. International financial centres and development finance institutions, the conduits for investment and aid, are faced with increasing challenges in attracting investors. De-risking has made it more difficult for the diaspora to support their families with remittances, it has affected tourism – the lifeblood of many island economies – and contributed to some airlines and cruise ships no longer visiting the region. The islands of the Caribbean are now becoming uncompetitive and losing the impetus in their developmental goals. The impoverishing of developing countries by the west is nothing new. The probable root cause of the banking exodus is the blacklisting of these small island developing states by the Financial Action Task Force, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and more recently the EU Commission. Blacklisting comes from the global reform movement to clamp down on money laundering and financing of terrorism. Over the past two decades these US and European bodies have held the Caribbean and countries in Africa and the Pacific to stringent standards not mirrored in their own institutions. This results in the perception that the developing countries engage in rampant corruption and are not applying anti-money laundering regulations or countering the financing of terrorism, while enabling tax evasion and other economic crimes. This is reinforced by Transparency International’s corruption perception index but sometimes it can simply mean countries at the top of rankings are better at corruption than those at the bottom. However, the reality is different. The continued inclusion of countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and even Haiti and Vanuatu, on these lists is largely due to the changing of the assessment criteria and the definition of the money supply. The standard explanation is that these countries did not make commitments to transparency and exchange of information. Moving the goalposts for vulnerable nations once again – while the real money launderers in London, New York, Luxembourg and Switzerland have been exposed as facilitating Russian oligarchs with parking spaces for their illicit gains. Closer examination of compliance challenges in the islands show a proactive commitment, even with limited resources, to engage with the rules of “know your customer” processes such as enhanced due diligence, verification of the sources of funds and the beneficial ownership of companies. Implementing these policies takes time and costs money, making setting up a bank account – whether for a business or an individual – protracted and difficult. Such perceptions are leading an increasing number of banks to de-risk in the region. They have decided that the risk versus the reward is too great, that these countries’ economies are too small and compliance is too costly. More than a third have left the region. This has reduced the Caribbean’s access to the global financial system that depends on correspondent banking relationships. Ironically the system sometimes exposes the very institutions that wield the big regulatory stick and whose methodology is rarely questioned. The World Bank’s Ease of doing business index was once the go-to guideline for the investment community, even though it often had a negative impact on developing countries. The index was discontinued in September 2021 after an independent report found “data irregularities” and “ethical concerns” with a number of officials, including the current IMF managing director, accused of inflating data to boost China’s ranking. The IMF board later found there was no conclusive demonstration of wrongdoing. While the black and grey-listed countries are subject to such double standards, bias and suspect data, they face the additional blow of being increasingly excluded from financial systems. The same regulations designed to mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing will result in individuals and businesses seeking alternatives outside the conventional banking system, creating underground networks. Alternatives to the Swift system are becoming available, although not yet in the Caribbean. The Russian SPFS and China’s Cips are two examples, as well as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. This should be a warning to those concerned about countries such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, which supply oil and gas to Europe and the US, and will now be evaluating the one-sided relationship and the inequity of trading with their western allies.","publicationTime":1668148204.000000000,"title":"Banks are leaving the Caribbean.

Altcointurk’s all-male inhabitants were not worried – in the chaotic world of cryptocurrency, their fortunes could soon change. “A lot of people come here, some are rich, some are poor. But the target is always getting rich – although a lot of people think that if they invest a hundred dollars, they will get a million,” said one founder of Altcointurk known only as Shark, who pointedly added that he has trademarked his nickname. “Other people come here to take their first lessons in the technical side of crypto, and then start to trade,” he said. Altcointurk was founded to teach Turkish citizens about how to invest in cryptocurrencies, which provide a digital, decentralised alternative to the mainstream financial system. Cryptocurrency trading has boomed in popularity in Turkey during a financial crisis that halved the value of the lira last year, while inflation recently surged above 30%, a two-decade high. While most Turkish citizens looking to avoid the devaluation of their savings in lira tend to reinvest in dollars or gold, an increasing number of younger investors see cryptocurrencies as the way forward. This has drawn the ire of the government, particularly President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who declared that “we are in a war against Bitcoin” and recently unveiled a programme to encourage Turkish citizens to switch their savings to lira and stash the cash in the banks. To cryptocurrency believers, the increasing lack of trust in government solutions is proof that digital currencies are the best alternative to Turkey’s embattled lira. Yet whether cryptocurrencies genuinely provide an opportunity to get rich is unclear. Evangelists such as the Altcointurk founders say that if the influx of unknowing investors risk falling prey to scams or simply wasting their money, it is the fault of the individual. “People play at cryptocurrency trading like they’re gambling, like betting,” said Shark. I ask if this means people are essentially trying to gamble in order to get rich. “Yes, yes. It’s exactly like betting,” he said, laughing. Shark declined to reveal how much money he has made through cryptocurrency investments, citing concerns that the government might suddenly swoop in and tax his gains. Altcointurk members – by their own estimates – have trained more than 300 people since the hub started five years ago, and more attend a weekly event they host to preach the wonders of crypto. But they are careful how they operate in an uncertain regulatory environment, sticking purely to teaching people how to trade rather than directly assisting or discussing the benefits of any one currency. “We’re providing a point of view,” said Shark. Cryptocurrencies exist in a legal grey area in Turkey. The government banned their use to pay for goods and services in April last year, while trading them is still permitted. Several exchanges, where citizens can trade lira or usually US dollars for cryptocurrency, have closed in recent months amid confusion over the trade’s legal status. Others have closed following high-profile scandals, such as the exchange Thodex, which shut down after the owner fled the country taking at least $2bn (£1.5bn) in funds with him. But for some, the sense that others are getting rich outweighs their own sense of risk. “The huge volatility encourages people, as well as the news that other people made profits from previous bull runs,” said one crypto investor, who asked to be identified only by his initials, BG. BG owns a digital media agency, and began investing in cryptocurrencies in 2017. “Even my mother is asking me to help her invest in Bitcoin now,” he said. “This started with the young, and now older people are interested. They give their money to their children or younger people and say: ‘Invest this for me, let’s see how it goes.’ “The risk is not investing itself, it’s because people might invest in unregulated exchanges without any protection from the government and end up losing all their money.” The true size of the cryptocurrency market in Turkey is hard to estimate as many of the figures are produced by the industry itself. Bitcoin.com, a news site associated with the cryptocurrency, said in December that Turkey had surpassed a million trades a day. An estimated 5 million people in Turkey currently operate cryptocurrency trading accounts, according to politicians seeking to regulate the trade. “While there’s clearly some segment of the market that can invest in cryptocurrency, I don’t think it’s for the average consumer to all hold a bit of crypto,” said Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, an expert in the relationship between cryptocurrency and emerging markets at Warwick Business School. Viswanath-Natraj pointed to the appeal of cryptocurrency in countries such as Turkey or Venezuela where inflation is high, but added that consumers are more likely to benefit if they choose so-called stablecoins, whose value is pegged to external factors such as the dollar. “The day-to-day fluctuations in Bitcoin are in the order of 10%, it’s high, so I wouldn’t advocate a complete reshuffle of savings to speculative cryptocurrencies,” he said. Following a steep drop in the value of the lira last December, Erdoğan announced a new financial scheme to encourage citizens to deposit their money in Turkish banks to raise the value of the currency. The scheme has attracted 90bn lira (£4.7bn) in deposits, but little of this has reportedly come from foreign currency as intended. “It’s a win-win opportunity on paper,” said BG. He said he declined to participate, as the programme requires long-term investments. Others, he said, felt it was simply too risky to trust the government. “People opposed to the government, those that support the [political] opposition, they have trust issues,” he said. “Once you have trust issues, you don’t convert your money and enrol in a government campaign like this. It’s a good idea on paper but fundamentally it won’t solve any economic problems. Long-term, it’s not going to help anything.” As the government attempts to encourage lira investments, Turkey’s parliament is drafting a law to regulate cryptocurrency markets, currently the subject of fierce debate among crypto enthusiasts. Some fear undue regulation in an industry where freedom is prized. Others say that limited regulation is necessary to protect consumers from predatory exchanges. Professional traders such as Bünyamin Emeç were dismissive of the government’s attempts to regulate the industry. “They have no clue what they’re doing, and decisions will be made by people who don’t understand how cryptocurrency works,” he said. The appeal of engaging with an industry without government interference is also seen by some like Emeç as a reason to invest. “I call on people to move towards these liberating [trading] platforms – this is my mission, basically. It’s a way of life,” he said. Emeç said continuing to invest in cryptocurrency was the only way for him to recoup $10m in digital currency trading losses and a Bitcoin scam that cost him more than $1m. “It’s a very volatile market, so I can only get that amount of money back through the same market,” he said.

But all that could change with a simple switch in the way it is coded, according to a campaign launched on Tuesday. The campaign, called Change the Code Not the Climate and coordinated by Environmental Working Group, Greenpeace USA and several groups battling bitcoin mining facilities in their communities, is calling on bitcoin to change the way bitcoins are mined in order to tackle its outsized carbon footprint. The software code that bitcoin uses – known as “proof of work” – requires the use of massive computer arrays to validate and secure transactions. Proof of work is a way of checking that a miner has solved the extremely complex cryptographic puzzles needed to add to the bitcoin ledger. Rival cryptocurrency ethereum is shifting to another system – “proof of stake” – that it believes will reduce its energy use by 99%. In the proof of stake model, miners pledge their coins to verify transactions; adding inaccurate information leads to penalties. With the value and use of cryptocurrencies rising, the campaign’s organizers argue bitcoin must follow suit or find another, less energy intensive, method. “This is a big problem. In part because of where the industry stands now but also because of our concerns about its growth,” said Michael Brune, campaign director and former executive director of Sierra Club. The US now leads the world in cryptocurrency mining after China launched a crackdown on mining and trading last May. “Coal plants which were dormant or slated to be closed are now being revived and solely dedicated to bitcoin mining. Gas plants, which in many cases were increasingly economically uncompetitive, are also now being dedicated to bitcoin mining. We are seeing this all across the country,” said Brune. Brune added: “It’s particularly painful to see this in the electric sector because that is precisely the place where the US has made most of its progress in the last decade,” he said. “There’s no way we can reach our climate goals if we are reviving fossil fuel plants. Some bitcoin miners have recently begun powering their operations using renewable energy from wind and solar. But Brune said while such moves were “clearly well-intentioned”, adding “some boutique wind or solar operations powering a few high- profile mining operations” would not do enough to counter the environmental cost. “Fossil fuel growth is outpacing renewable growth in bitcoin mining and that’s the fundamental challenge,” Brune said. Without a change to the code, the fundamental problem will remain that bitcoin’s code “incentivizes maximum energy use”, said Chris Larsen, founder and executive chairman of crypto company Ripple and a climate activist. “The minute that there is the opportunity to go to something dirty, which is what you are seeing, that is going to happen.” One “nightmare scenario”, he said, is that the world does get to a renewable future in China, the US and EU but countries rich in fossil fuel switch to bitcoin mining to keep their operations running. “Imagine the Saudis sitting on all that oil, which has a cost of about ½ cent per kilowatt hour – no renewable can match that,” Larsen said. “Bitcoin mining could be this endless monetization engine for fossil fuels. That would be a nightmare.” The campaign is launching with digital advertising in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Marketwatch, Politico, Facebook and other publications. Organizers are also taking legal action against proposed mining sites and using their large memberships to push bitcoin’s biggest investors and influencers to call for a code change. “In this world, with all these smart people, there has got to be a better solution,” said Larsen.","publicationTime":1648526472.000000000,"title":"Climate groups say a change in coding can reduce bitcoin energy consumption by 99%","id":"technology/2022/mar/29/bitcoin-reduce-energy-consumption-climate-groups"},{"body":"Since powdered rhino horn has (rightly) been banned, only two aphrodisiacs remain: political power and great wealth. Of these, the second is the more interesting, partly because most humans, especially journalists, seem to be affected by it. It’s what leads them to assume that if someone is fabulously rich, then she or he must be very smart. That’s why the super-rich are invariably surrounded by fawning sycophants – and also why they eventually come to believe that they themselves are geniuses. Which brings us neatly to Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley’s leading contrarian. With a net worth of perhaps $5bn (£3.9bn), he is undoubtedly rich, though not in the Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos or even Bill Gates league. But since he is the only public intellectual that the tech industry has produced, there is a widespread belief that he must also be a deep thinker, which is why organisations ask him to give “keynote” speeches. The function of such addresses is to give an elevated tone to what are otherwise sordid proceedings, which explains why Thiel was invited to address the 2022 bitcoin conference in Miami, which was billed as “a four-day pilgrimage for those seeking greater freedom and individual sovereignty”. Given that the attendees at this shindig were likely subscribers to the view that he is a genius, it was an easy gig for the great man. Think of it as Narendra Modi addressing the annual conference of the Bharatiya Janata party and you’ll get the general idea. Thiel was there to tell the attendees that they were the Lord’s anointed. Bitcoin is the new gold that one day should take its place alongside the precious metal as the world’s store of value, replacing equities (ie company shares), which, at $115tn are currently much bigger than gold ($12tn). This will happen when the value of a single bitcoin (currently about £30,000) will increase by at least a hundredfold, making a single coin worth £3m. But it will only happen if a sinister cabal of old-world reactionaries – the “finance gerontocracy” of the veteran investor Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon (head of JP Morgan Chase) and Larry Fink (chief executive of BlackRock) – is defeated. Stirring stuff, eh? The strange thing is that this call to arms was delivered in such a shambling manner. Here is a literal transcription of the relevant passage, starting 14 minutes into Thiel’s speech: “Why has it [bitcoin] not yet converged with gold for, um, or even with the equity markets more broadly, and what what is going to, you know, what is it going to take for this for this to happen? And, ah, I know that sort of the ways we oftentimes talk about, um, businesses or technologies, you know, how great the technology is, how great the code is, how great the math is, you know, how how it’s sort of innovative, but I want to sort of suggest that we should maybe think of, we should think of, we should think of it at least in one dimension as sort of a political question and it’s a movement and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to, um, succeed or whether, um, whether the enemies of the movement are going to succeed in stopping us and so I want to maybe end with, um, you know, an enemies list.” Thiel’s rhetorical deficiencies make him an unlikely leader of a political movement. But the aphrodisiacal effect of his wealth meant that his speech was widely reported. Yet the strange thing is that his record as an investor seems patchy, to say the least. He made his first pile from PayPal, which was a shrewd bet. He was the first big investor in Facebook, sure, but then he tried to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to sell it to Yahoo for $1bn in 2006 and then sold much of his holding after the company’s IPO in 2012. He foresaw the banking catastrophe of 2008, but failed to sell out beforehand. And, according to his biographer, much of his wealth comes from his skill at finding clever ways to limit his tax exposure: his investments in Facebook, Palantir and some others were made through a vehicle known as a Roth IRA that was originally intended for “ordinary” people – ie middle-class taxpayers. As David Runciman put it in his book review of Max Chafkin’s The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power: “Thiel is not a genius investor. He is, like almost everyone else, a nervous investor, prone to panic and regret. He’s just another hedgie chasing his tail.” But if Thiel isn’t a genius, or even a latterday Cicero, he’s nevertheless dangerous. In an essay published in 2009 he famously said that he no longer believed that freedom and democracy are compatible. And he’s using his money to try to change the balance of power in the deadlocked US Senate in the next round of congressional elections by giving two $10m donations to the Super Pacs that are backing two of his proteges, JD Vance and Arizona Republican Blake Masters. In that sense, Thiel looks less like a tech genius and more like the Koch Brothers – Charles and his late sibling, David – who have done more to reshape Republican politics than anyone other than Donald J Trump. And that’s a good reason for taking him seriously, whatever happens to bitcoin.

In his speech, the former prime minister suggested the advent of blockchain was full of possibilities and appeared to compare it to major technological innovations such as the invention of fire, the railways, and the internet. But Johnson also said he supported the idea of more regulation of cryptocurrencies and argued that its advocates “have to convince people that their use cases are real and work for them in their lives, opposed to this being about speculation and a new type of financial market or instrument”. “When there is a mania and a bubble, when you have speculators driving up prices by finding a wider pool of people to exploit, you do need measures to protect the public from Ponzi schemes,” he said. Johnson has not yet declared how much he was paid for the speech or who funded it and his trip to Singapore, where he disclosed he was staying in the five-star hotel Raffles, which can cost £1,000 a night. It comes after he was paid £276,130 from the Council of Insurance Agents &amp; Brokers for another speech in the US. He has also taken almost £40,000 of free accommodation from the family of Anthony Bamford, a major Conservative party donor, £11,560 of hospitality from Rupert Murdoch in the US and £10,000 of hospitality at Heathrow airport’s royal suite. Blockchain technology is used to provide a secure way of making and recording transactions, most commonly for the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is largely unregulated but it has come under intense scrutiny from governments in recent weeks following the demise of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, leaving thousands frozen out of their savings. The value of the best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has also plunged. Many cryptocurrency giants have been arguing in favour of regulation but some governments and regulators fear that this would give it status and credibility by putting it on a par with traditional finance. This week, the European Central Bank said bitcoin is on an “artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance”, in a scathing intervention arguing against giving regulatory legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. However, supporters of the technology include the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who has previously said he wants to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has also vocally supported the technologies behind cryptocurrency, and took £11,638 of hospitality to attend a cryptocurrency conference called Permissionless in Florida, as well as £10,000 to speak at a fintech conference called LendIt. Speaking at the International Symposium on Blockchain Advancements (ISBA) in Singapore, Johnson described the room of blockchain enthusiasts as “pioneers at the cutting edge of a new and still infant technology whose possibility the whole world is struggling to assess”, adding: “Given the huge controversies of some use cases … and given all the delicacies and sensitivities, I will do my best to tiptoe through the minefield with the tact for which I am famed.” He also urged them, as “innovators everywhere [do], with the possible exception of Singapore, come to London, come to the UK”. Johnson said technology was “morally neutral” and scepticism about its uses were “generally wrong”. He also said the “blockchain idea seems to me to have all sorts of possibilities to allow people to deal with people without a third party to authenticate”, but he drew a distinction between the technology and its use through cryptocurrencies. On cryptocurrencies, he said his question was “who is in charge of the clattering train, because I’ve seen some pretty shocking headlines about this whole venture and I think we are going to need to have some way of holding people to account”. “If it’s going to succeed and if it’s going to build trust, then it’s obviously got to be regulated in such as way to command confidence in such a way as to visibly protect all participants,” Johnson said. He said a better relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and politicians “would have to happen if this thing has a future”. Johnson also gave his views on Twitter, saying it could be an “intimidating environment for politicians” and “pile-ons” were like “nothing they had been prepared for”. He said a “twitstorm can flare up like a typhoon in the south China seas and cause your plane to buffet but it doesn’t really reflect what’s going on in the rest of the world”. However, he said politicians would need to “learn to have thicker skins about it” and find “ways of doing it without feeling beaten up – I don’t read much of it”.","publicationTime":1669994437.000000000,"title":"Boris Johnson hails blockchain ‘possibilities’ at Singapore conference","id":"politics/2022/dec/02/boris-johnson-hails-blockchain-possibilities-at-singapore-conference"},{"body":"Crypto exchanges Coinbase and BlockFi are laying off hundreds of staff members, equivalent to a fifth of their workforces, as they struggle to survive the second wave of the ongoing crypto crash. Employees at Coinbase, once the flagship US cryptocurrency exchange, will learn whether they have lost their jobs in an email today. Those who have been laid off will be notified on their personal email account, the chief executive, Brian Armstrong, said, because their access to company systems will be terminated immediately. “I realise that removal of access will feel sudden and unexpected, and this is not the experience I wanted for you,” Armstrong said in a letter to staff. “I want to say thank you for giving everything to this company, and that I am sorry.

I am incredibly grateful for everything you have done to contribute to our success.” Almost 20% of Coinbase staff will lose their jobs, Armstrong said, totalling about 1,100 employees, even after the company embarked on a hiring freeze that resulted in it rescinding already-issued job offers. Coinbase’s cuts follow on from those of its smaller competitor BlockFi, whose chief executive, Zac Prince, announced a 20% reduction in staff, affecting about 170 people, on Monday. “Like many others in tech, we’ve been impacted by the dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions, which have had a negative impact on our growth rate,” Prince said. While both companies have been hit by the dramatic downturn in tech valuations, they are also struggling with a new crash in the crypto industry. After a month of stability following the collapse of the Terra “stablecoin”, the crypto bank Celsius announced on Sunday it was suspending customer withdrawals after weeks of fears of insolvency, prompting a 25% drop in the price of bitcoin and ethereum. “Due to extreme market conditions, today we are announcing that Celsius is pausing all withdrawals, swap, and transfers between accounts,” the platform said. “We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations.”","publicationTime":1655215611.000000000,"title":"Crypto exchanges Coinbase and BlockFi lay off hundreds of staff","id":"technology/2022/jun/14/crypto-exchanges-coinbase-blockfi-staff-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-price"},{"body":"A line of large blue skips full of chopped wood sit at the back of a site belonging to Norway’s biggest bitcoin mining operation, a 5,000 sq metre warehouse on the outskirts of Hønefoss, a small town 40 miles west of Oslo. Hot air is being pumped into the 12 skips through bendy corrugated pipes curling out from the warehouse. Despite the snow, it will take a few days for the logs to be dried out, after which a local lumberjack, grateful for the free service, will take them away for sale. The wood is being warmed by some of the so-called waste heat being emitted from thousands of stacked-high computer servers, known as miners, working away inside the warehouse. It is one of two such sites owned by the Norwegian company Kryptovault. The company expects its mining to account for just under 1% of the computing and process power in the global bitcoin network later this year. Bitcoin mining, the process of earning cryptocurrency by solving complex computational math puzzles and verifying transactions in the process, is famously energy-intensive. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that as a result, the sector consumes more energy in a year than many countries, including Argentina, Pakistan and Poland. Heat is an inevitable waste byproduct. Despite noise from ventilation fans so loud that the company had to spend about £1.5m on insulation after complaints from neighbours, the hot areas in the Hønefoss warehouse can reach 55C. For many, at a time of rocketing energy prices, this may be further evidence of the unsustainability of a business that was recently described by Robert McCauley, a senior fellow at Boston University’s global development policy centre, as “worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme”. The critics are certainly circling. Russia’s central bank has proposed outlawing all cryptocurrency operations in the country, and China has already done so. Swedish regulators have called for something similar in Europe. Norway’s regional development minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, told the Guardian his government was reviewing its options. “Although crypto-mining and its underlying technology might represent some possible benefits in the long run, it is difficult to justify the extensive use of renewable energy today,” Gram said. “The ministry of local government and regional development is currently reviewing potential policy measures in order to address the challenges related to extensive energy usage caused by crypto-mining.” But there is a fightback brewing in the sector, of which Kryptovault, which uses only renewable energy, is a part. This week, the billionaire Michael Novogratz, the owner of Galaxy Digital, a digital assets company that seeks to become “the Goldman Sachs of crypto”, launched a sustainability programme on energy use and social responsibility, saying the industry needed to tackle a “false narrative around it being bad for the environment”. It has been described by some critics as greenwashing, but within a world that has until now been less than transparent over its activities, preferring secrecy over sympathy, this was a shift. Kjetil Hove Pettersen, 39, Kryptovault’s chief executive, who founded the company with friends after deciding to turn a hobby into a business, said he also believed it was time for the sector to push back at the prevailing narrative. “If you look at the total energy cost, globally, for any given thing, it’s always going to be huge – I think we can always compare to that of a small European country,” he said. “That includes also traditional gold mining, which takes more than four times the amount of energy as bitcoin mining.” Advocates for bitcoin argue that it offers the opportunity to exchange value with someone instantly without using a third party such as a bank, without permission and virtually for free. They say it is being adopted at a faster rate than the internet in the 1990s, with El Salvador having become the first country to adopt it as legal tender, alongside the US dollar, in spite of misgivings from the International Monetary Fund. Pettersen said people wanted bitcoin, and mining operations provided economic returns through tax and employment. Mining is further said to offer a way for countries with excess renewable energy supply from hydro, wind or solar power at certain times and seasons to make value of it within their own borders and without transfer costs. Estimates of what proportion of the energy used in mining is renewable vary from 25% to 57%. “Mining is not polluting in itself,” said Pettersen. “If you are running coal to run mining then that’s another story, that’s what you don’t want. Mining should be done in more than places like Norway – and it can be a way to save trapped energy. For example, in northern Norway where there is excess, or in El Salvador where they are now using energy from volcanoes, setting up production when it wasn’t there before.” Kryptovault aims to have 15,000 miners at work by this autumn. Otto Him, 37 and Martin Mikalsen, 26, who manage the Hønefoss mine, have nicknamed one area between two huge walls, or pods, of 6,500 computers as “the cathedral”, in recognition of its awesome scale. The company is transitioning from older bitcoin miners to new ones shipped from China that are said to be three times more efficient. There will be plenty more waste heat to use. The company is in early talks to dry seaweed for a local firm. Pettersen says the narrative will change. “At some point, country after country will adopt bitcoin as legal tender and at some point it will be obvious that it is going to change the world,” he said. “Just as it became obvious that the internet was here to stay.” Top 10 countries for bitcoin mining activity 1) Kazakhstan 2) Russia 3) Ireland* 4) Germany* 5) Sweden 6) Norway 7) Iceland 8) UK 9) France 10) Georgia *Evidence of activity probably inflated owing to redirected IP addresses via the use of VPN or proxy services.

The US arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange said on Thursday that it was taking “proactive steps” in its transition to a crypto-only exchange for the time being. While trading, staking, deposits and withdrawals in cryptocurrencies would remain fully operational, customers would be unable to deposit or withdraw US dollars from the exchange, as “our payment and banking partners have signalled their intent to pause USD fiat channels as early as June 13, 2023”. Binance.US said it encouraged its customers to “withdraw their USD” by 13 June but warned that because of elevated volumes, withdrawal might take longer than usual to process. The company stressed that customer funds were “safe, secure and available”. Binance.US is an offshoot of Binance.com, a cryptocurrency exchange that had grown rapidly after starting operations in 2017 into a company making billions of dollars of revenues, mostly from transaction fees as customers bought and sold cryptocurrencies. Binance and other exchanges provided a key entry point for many people into cryptocurrencies, allowing people to buy assets such as bitcoin using “fiat” currencies such as the US dollar. Binance’s success made Zhao, also known as CZ, one of the world’s richest people on paper, and he has been a key advocate for the crypto industry. Forbes estimated his net worth at $10.5bn (£8.4bn) this week, although much of that wealth is derived from his ownership of Binance. Regulators have for several years been examining the features of some digital assets to decide whether they are in fact new versions of securities such as stocks or bonds. Securities trading is tightly regulated across the biggest financial markets. On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a financial watchdog, accused Binance and Zhao of operating a “web of deception”, charging him and his exchange with 13 offences including violations of the US Securities Act and acting as an unregistered exchange. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency platform, a day later. The SEC has escalated its crackdown on the crypto industry in recent months after the collapse last year of the Bahamas-based FTX, whose founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has now been charged with securities fraud, money laundering and other offences. Earlier on Thursday, US regulators said they supported a freeze on Binance’s assets, according to an SEC court filing. In its statement, Binance.US accused the SEC of “extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in its pursuit of an ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry”. The company that this had created challenges for the unnamed banks it worked with. Binance.US says it is an entirely separate exchange that is run separately from its parent company. However, among the central allegations from the SEC is that Binance and Zhao failed to truly split the US company from the main exchange from which it was spun off. The SEC alleged that the parent company of Binance.US was set up by Binance and Zhao to “knowingly circumvent US law while secretly controlling the Binance.US platform’s operations for their benefit”, according to a brief filed by the regulator. The SEC alleged that in reality, Binance and Zhao “subverted their own controls to secretly allow high-value US customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform”. Zhao has repeatedly and strenuously denied wrongdoing. On Twitter he has retweeted a series of criticisms of the SEC by others, and on Thursday night he retweeted the Binance.US announcement on suspending dollar deposits. Binance has said it “respectfully disagrees” with the allegations, and that “any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong”.","publicationTime":1686287181.000000000,"title":"Binance.US prepares to suspend US dollar deposits and withdrawals from exchange","id":"business/2023/jun/09/binanceus-prepares-to-suspend-us-dollar-deposits-and-withdrawals-from-exchange"},{"body":"Here’s a quick summary of what happened today: The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, the most serious action taken by US regulators against the company. The SEC said that Binance operated a shell company, Binance.US, to skirt federal regulators, along with diverting customer funds to outside entities. Binance issued a response to the SEC’s lawsuit saying that it had been complying with regulators’ “questions” and was looking to negotiate a settlement with the agency. In the aftermath of news of the complaint, the price of Bitcoin fell below $26,000 for the first time since March. We’ll be closing this blog for now. Thanks for reading. You can read the full report on the lawsuit here: Seems like Christiano Ronaldo was set to announce a partnership with Binance soon. Ronaldo collaborated with Binance on an NFT collection last fall. Before the SEC filed an official complaint against Binance for trying to bypassing US regulatory laws, Reuters published two investigative reports last year that detailed how the company became a conduit for money laundering and how it built up a plan to avoid US regulators. The investigations make it clear that much of what the SEC has sued Binance after had been coming to the surface for years. In June of last year, Reuters reported that at least $2.35bn in illicit funds were exchanged through Binance. The funds came from hacking, investment frauds and illegal drug sales. Then in October, Reuters published another investigation into Binance’s plan to set up a US operations that could appear to be independent, for the sake of US regulations, but would actually be a subsidiary of Binance. The company, Binance.US, publicly said that it would handle US investors, who would go through a rigorous screening and validation process. Instead, the company worked to quickly register users instead of conduct money laundering checks, former employees and advisers told Reuters. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance will likely make it harder for the company to curry favors with regulators in other countries, including the UK, where the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said Binance is not capable of being regulated. Binance in the past had said it will still do “everything” to change the FCA’s mind. Here’s more from the Guardian’s global technology editor Dan Milmo: As part of any UK process, Binance will need to register with the FCA, which requires crypto-exchanges to prove they have systems in place to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. The regulator said it did not comment on specific companies but its official position on Binance had not changed since 2021, when it barred the business from regulated activity in the UK. At the time that FCA said the firm was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. It appears nothing has happened yet to change that view. The regulator’s 2021 supervisory notice referred to Binance’s ownership structure as “complex” and with an “extensive geographical spread”, factors that appeared to be “hindering the provision of adequate and reliable information to the FCA”. In the aftermath of the SEC’s complaint against Binance, the price of Bitcoin has dropped below $26,000 for the first time since March. It’s not quite the jump seen after the collapse of FTX in November, when the price went from $20,000 to just above $15,000 in a matter of days, but it’s the first sign of instability in an already volatile sector. Today’s SEC complaint filed against Binance is just the latest in the company’s legal battles in the US. In March, regulators at a separate federal agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), filed its own lawsuit against the company alleging that it intended to grow its US customer base while publicly saying it was blocking US customers from its exchange. The gist of the complaint is the same as the SEC, as both agencies accuse Binance of purposefully skirting US regulators when growing their US operations. Here’s more from the story that was originally published March 27: The complaint alleges that Binance has grown its US business despite publicly stating its intent to block US customers from accessing the platform. Allegations in the complaint include a claim that even after announcing US restrictions Binance told its most valuable US customers how to avoid its compliance controls. “Defendants have disregarded applicable federal laws while fostering Binance’s US customer base because it has been profitable for them to do so,” the CFTC complaint stated. The CFTC said it was seeking punishments including fines and permanent trading bans. Gretchen Lowe, the CFTC’s chief counsel, said Binance had put profits ahead of complying with the law. The complaint alleges that Binance has broken the law by offering commodity derivatives transactions – which effectively place a bet on the price of a cryptocurrency rather than buying it directly – to US customers since July 2019, despite not being registered with the CFTC. Lowe said: “Defendants’ alleged willful evasion of US law is at the core of the commission’s complaint against Binance. The defendants’ own emails and chats reflect that Binance’s compliance efforts have been a sham and Binance deliberately chose – over and over – to place profits over following the law.” The 136-page complaint the SEC filed against Binance contains some scathing details about how CEO Changpeng Zhao and the company knowingly evaded legal scrutiny in the US for years while still profiting off of US investors. “Zhao and Binance understood that they were operating the Binance.com platform in violation of numerous US laws, including the federal securities laws, and that these ongoing violations presented existential risks to their business,” the complaint reads. “As Binance’s CCO [chief commercial office] bluntly admitted to another Binance compliance officer in December 2018, “we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro”. The complaint then goes into how Binance hired several consultants to advise them on their exposure in the US. Ultimately, the company decided to pursue a company it called its “Tai Chi entity”. As first reported by Reuters in the fall, Binance imagined the company would essentially be a shell company that would serve as the target of US enforcement. They called the company Binance.US, and the plan is ultimately what got Binance into hot water with US regulators. Here’s more from Binance on the SEC lawsuit. The company has rejected allegations that customer funds were at risk as “simply wrong”. The company also vowed to “vigorously defend” itself against the claims. The statement added: “All user assets on Binance and Binance affiliate platforms, including Binance.US, are safe and secure, and we will vigorously defend against any allegations to the contrary.” The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a total of 13 charges against Binance in US federal court. The core of the SEC’s complaint against Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao is that the company knowingly skirted US regulations and deceived US investors and regulators about how it was operating its exchange. The SEC says that Zhao and Binance, which was founded in Shanghai but has since moved out of China after the country banned cryptocurrency trades, falsely claimed the exchange banned US customers when in fact the company was secretly allowing traders access to the exchange. Binance said it created Binance.US, a separate, independent trading platform specifically for US investors, Zhao and Binance was controlling the entity behind the scenes. The complaint says that Zhao and Binance exercised unlawful control over customer funds, including diverting them to outside entities that were also owned by Zhao, including one called Sigma Chain. Binance “misled” investors about trading control the company said it offered on the Binance.US platform and instead diverted funds to Sigma Chan. With the diverted funds, Zhao and Binance “engaged in manipulative trading” that led to an artificial increase in the platform’s trading value. It also diverted money to another Zhao-owned trading firm, Merit Peak Limited. Other charges encompass broader accusations against Binance for operating in the US as an unregistered national securities exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, accusing the company and Zhao of operating an illegal cryptocurrency exchange using billions of dollars in Binance customer funds. This is the biggest crackdown of the cryptocurrency exchange and will likely cause a rumble in the cryptocurrency world, which was shaken by the collapse of FTX in the fall, what was the second-largest exchange to Binance. “Through 13 charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of law,” SEC head Gary Gensler said in a statement. In its own statement on its website, Binance denounced the lawsuit saying that the company has been been “actively cooperating” with the investigation and “worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns”. “Most recently, we have engaged in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigation,” the statement said. “Despite our efforts, with its complaint today the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate.” The company said it plans to “defend our platform vigorously”. This is Lauren Aratani in New York.

Here we look at what has happened to FTX, why, and what it means for the wider market. What is FTX? Officially headquartered in the Bahamas, FTX is managed from the US, with its biggest offices in Chicago and Miami. It is a cryptocurrency exchange, helping people buy and sell crypto assets. Cryptocurrencies are all based on the same basic structure as their star asset, bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. FTX is big and important because, along with its rival, Binance, it processes the majority of cryptocurrency trades around the world. Both FTX and Binance are “international” exchanges, the cryptocurrency equivalent of an offshore casino. Each also operates an arms-length US-regulated outlet, which closely follows what little regulation there is from the US government, but the bulk of the money that flows through their books is in effect unconstrained by regulatory requirements. What happened to FTX this week? On Wednesday last week, an article appeared in CoinDesk, a crypto industry news service, that triggered a crisis. It claimed that the balance sheet of Alameda, a crypto hedge fund owned by FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, held billions of dollars worth of FTX’s own cryptocurrency, FTT, and had been using it as collateral in further loans. If this were the case, then a fall in FTT’s value could damage both businesses, given their shared ownership. But FTT itself had no value beyond FTX’s longstanding promise to buy any tokens at $22, prompting fears that the whole institution was a castle built on sand. The slow-burn crisis was kicked into high gear on Sunday when Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, tweeted that his company was selling its FTT holdings, worth about $500m, because of “recent revelations that have come to light”. Things snowballed from there. The value of FTT collapsed, and FTX customers started withdrawing funds in a bank-run-style exodus. In a message to staff this week, cited by Reuters, Bankman-Fried said the firm suffered a “giant withdrawal surge” as users rushed to take out $6bn (£5.1bn) in crypto tokens from FTX over a three-day period. Daily withdrawals normally ran to tens of millions of dollars, Bankman-Fried told his employees. Zhao then stepped in to rescue FTX, agreeing on Tuesday to buy the company but then announcing on Wednesday that he was stepping away from the deal. “The issues are beyond our control or ability to help,” Binance said, citing discoveries in the due diligence process and the launch of regulatory investigations in the US. What next for FTX? The company either needs to find billions of dollars to meet customers’ withdrawal demands, or to stem the exodus by finding a way of reassuring them their money is safe. That is never easy when so many customers are rushing for the door. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Bankman-Fried had said the firm needed $4bn to stay solvent, with a funding gap of $8bn. There are also deeper questions for the exchange. Just a day before the company agreed to sell to Binance, Bankman-Fried tweeted that FTX was “fine” and that it did not trade with customer assets at all. But a message to investors from Sequoia Capital, a VC firm that ploughed $150m into FTX, said the company was facing not just a liquidity crunch but solvency problems – meaning it owed more money than it actually had. The day after the sale fell through, “SBF” resurfaced, and apologised for his failures. “I fucked up twice,” he wrote, kicking off a series of tweets in which he apologised for poor communications and said he had mistakenly assumed the exchange could not face a liquidity crunch, but argued that it was not actually insolvent. Bankman-Fried’s apology only went so far, however, and users still had questions, particularly given other claims that he was making at the same time. The Wall Street Journal reported that FTX had loaned $10bn of customer funds to Alameda to gamble with, a substantial proportion of the exchange’s $16bn in assets. Could there be a spillover to the rest of crypto? There already is. Since the crisis at FTX began, bitcoin has plummeted from $20k a coin to $16.5k, its lowest value since 2020. The wider sector has fallen almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and big companies and protocols that have exposure to FTX are having to prove their own liquidity. A popular token on the Solana protocol, for instance, that lets users of that blockchain trade bitcoin, relies on FTX for its value: if the exchange goes under, it is unclear whether any of the bitcoin on that protocol would be retrievable, wiping millions of dollars from existence overnight. And, as with every crypto crash, all eyes are on Tether, the $70bn “stablecoin” that underpins much of the sector’s economy. On Thursday morning, the token slipped off its “peg”, trading at $0.98 to the dollar. The chief technology officer (CTO) of the company that issues Tether, Paolo Ardoino, tweeted to reassure investors, noting that the company had processed about $700m of withdrawals over the past 24 hours. “No issues,” he said, “we keep going.” What about into wider markets? The financial system’s resilience to wobbles in the crypto market has already been tested over the past 12 months with the onset of a new “crypto winter”. The value of the entire crypto market reached a peak of $3tn last November but then collapsed this year owing to a mix of crypto-specific events and wider macroeconomic issues and is currently hovering at around $800bn. Over that period, global financial markets have suffered, too, but that is because of much bigger issues, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising interest rates. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at University of Sussex, adds that the extra blow to the industry’s credibility from the latest wobble will prolong the chill. “This crypto winter will go on a lot longer because of this.” She added that contagion from the crypto industry into traditional financial markets was still unlikely because institutional investors, always searching for high returns from their investments, were now finding it easier to earn from conventional assets in a high interest-rate environment. “The fact is that traditional investments, like bonds, are becoming more attractive. This means crypto is less of a systemic threat.”","publicationTime":1668093748.000000000,"title":"What happened to FTX and could the crisis spill over to the rest of crypto?","id":"technology/2022/nov/10/what-happened-to-ftx-and-could-crisis-spill-over-to-rest-of-crypto"},{"body":"A man suspected of being the fugitive South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur Do Kwon, accused of orchestrating a multi-billion-dollar fraud that shook global crypto markets last year, has been arrested in Montenegro. “Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,” the interior minister, Filip Adžić, tweeted late on Thursday. He said the suspect had been arrested at the airport in the capital, Podgorica, after being found carrying “falsified documents”. “We are waiting for official confirmation of identity,” Adžić added. In a statement, Montenegro’s interior ministry said two suspects were detained trying to board a plane to Dubai at Podgorica airport after police found forged Costa Rican and Belgian passports. South Korea asked Interpol in September to circulate a “red notice” for the 31-year-old across the agency’s 195 member nations. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform are wanted for fraud and the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin”, which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, about $40bn in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg in May last year. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit against Kwon and Terraform Labs in Manhattan federal court, accusing them of “orchestrating a multi-billion-dollar crypto asset securities fraud”. Stablecoins are designed to have a relatively fixed price and are usually pegged to a real-world commodity or currency. Many investors lost their life savings when Luna and Terra entered a death spiral, and South Korean authorities had opened multiple criminal probes into the crash. Cryptocurrencies have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators across the globe following a string of recent controversies, including the high-profile collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. FTX and its sister trading house, Alameda Research, went bankrupt late last year, dissolving a virtual trading business that had been valued by the market at $32bn. The fall of FTX has caused major doubts about the long-term viability of cryptocurrency and heaped stress on further platforms and entities that rode the success of bitcoin and other currencies. To add to its mounting woes, the digital currency sector has also been hit hard by the demise of US crypto lenders Silvergate and Signature amid a string of banking failures that have rattled global markets and sparked fears of future economic turmoil.","publicationTime":1679603080.000000000,"title":"Man suspected of being crypto fugitive Do Kwon arrested in Montenegro","id":"world/2023/mar/23/man-suspected-of-being-crypto-fugitive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro"},{"body":"Authorities have raided several sites around Leeds as part of what is believed to be the UK’s first crackdown on illegally operated crypto ATMs. Evidence was gathered from multiple sites around the city that were suspected to be hosting machines allowing customers to buy or convert traditional currencies into cryptoassets including bitcoin. The raids follow a joint investigation between the Financial Conduct Authority and the West Yorkshire police force’s digital intelligence and investigation unit. “The FCA will review evidence gathered during these visits and consider further potential enforcement action,” the regulator said. While the FCA does not regulate cryptoassets, it does require all firms dealing in crypto to register and prove they have effective anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls. There are no crypto ATMs registered with the FCA, meaning any crypto ATM operating in the UK is doing so illegally. DS Lindsey Brants of the cyber team at West Yorkshire police said the force issued a warning letter to operators, telling them to stop using the ATMs or risk being investigated under the UK’s money laundering regulations. The force then shared its findings with the FCA. “We are pleased to be able to work in partnership with the FCA in what we believe is a national first here in West Yorkshire,” Brants said. The FCA said it was working with “multiple law enforcement partners”, including other local police forces as it continues to investigate other sites that may be hosting illegal crypto ATMs. “We will continue to identify and disrupt unregistered crypto businesses operating in the UK,” Mark Steward, the FCA’s director in charge of enforcement and market oversight, said. “Crypto businesses operating in the UK need to be registered with the FCA for anti-money laundering purposes.

Built in 1949 as part of a push by the New York City Housing Authority to house the city’s low-income residents, Marcy had fallen into a state of dangerous disrepair by the 1970s when Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, was growing up there. “Where I’m from, Marcy son, ain’t nothing nice,” he raps in Where I’m From. “Marcy me, just the way I am always gonna be,” he declares in 2017’s Marcy Me. But while hip-hop’s first confirmed billionaire remains intent on not abandoning his roots, residents of the Marcy Houses expressed annoyance and skepticism at Carter’s latest venture, the Bitcoin Academy – a series of free “financial literacy” courses being offered exclusively to Marcy tenants this summer. On Wednesday afternoon, as bitcoin markets scraped two-year lows, few residents were aware of the cryptocurrency classes set to begin next week as a project sponsored by Carter and his friend and fellow crypto promoter Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter. (At least some of the flyers advertising the course appear to have been simply dumped on the floor of buildings.) “It’s kind of late to be doing that when people are trying to hold on to their dollars and everything is so expensive,” said 58-year-old retiree Myra Raspberry. “People don’t want to be investing money knowing that they might have a chance of losing it. Raspberry said she had seen news reports about bitcoin’s crash, and had no interest in participating in the course. “Every dime I get got to go to rent, phone, TV and internet. I don’t have money like that to be losing. If I did, I would try to invest in something that’s more reliable, like the basketball game last night. You know I’m going to win something from that.” She hasn’t heard anybody talking about bitcoin in her community, she said. “People looking to make money, not lose it.” The average household income for public housing residents in New York City is $24,454, according to the New York City Housing Authority. The 12-week Bitcoin Academy course will be taught by Lamar Wilson, who runs the website Black Bitcoin Billionaire, and Najah J Roberts, founder and CEO of a brick-and-mortar crypto school in California called Crypto Blockchain Plug. “The simple goal is to provide people tools to build independence for themselves and then the communities around them,” Carter tweeted, calling the course at Marcy “hopefully the first of many”. A spokesperson from the Bitcoin Academy said that participants will receive a free mobile hotspot device and a smartphone with a data plan, as they sit for lectures on topics including “What is money,” “What is blockchain,” and “How not to get scammed.” The academy also plans to grant students a small amount of bitcoin worth around $20-$25 after they learn to set up their own digital wallets. The spokesperson said an open house event at Marcy over the weekend drew a large and eager crowd of mostly seniors and young people. But younger Marcy Houses tenants who spoke to the Guardian were unenthused. Nyashia Figueroa, a 24-year-old resident who plans to work as a caretaker for mentally challenged people, said the Bitcoin Academy seemed unhelpful to residents. “Half the people that’s going to go to that class, probably just going to go to the class for the $25 that you get. The other half of the people, they’ll probably take what they learn and forget it down the line.” Figueroa said the bitcoin class signified how out of touch the rapper was with his former home. “If you want to do something, fix this place up,” she said. “We have a basketball court with no hoops. Our parks is broken up in here. He should be doing more for his community, not no Bitcoin Academy. “The only thing I could say he really did for us was the Christmas stuff. Every Christmas he would come around and he would give out free toys to the kids or like pocketbooks, perfumes and little MP3 players. That was good; the bitcoin ain’t.” Figueora added that the holiday giveaways haven’t happened in a while. “He stopped coming around, and then it was just his mother that was coming around for a long period of time. And now I don’t even know if they do it any more. “This is where he rep he’s from and all that, but he don’t do nothing for us.” Carter has directed some of his philanthropy, including scholarships and toy giveaways, to Marcy’s more than 4,000 predominantly Black and Latino residents. The last toy giveaway by the Shawn Carter Foundation occurred in 2017, according to the website of Carter’s wife, Beyoncé, and cost $8,452. The Shawn Carter Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment. One Marcy resident, Luis Rivas, did express enthusiasm for the class, saying, “I would like to learn how they become a millionaire, and learn what to trade and what not to trade.” Rivas, who is unemployed, said he had been acquainted with Jay-Z when they were both teenagers. “Now he’s a billionaire and I’m still living in the fucking ghetto.” Since it was announced last week, the Bitcoin Academy has faced criticism from tech commentators, who have accused the project of preying on financially vulnerable people. Some have compared the marketing of crypto to how predatory lenders targeted people of color with subprime loans in the run-up to the 2008 housing crisis. Proponents of cryptocurrency have long defended the technology as a way to build a new financial system for lower-income people. A 2021 research paper commissioned by a major New York City-based cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini, argued that cryptocurrency could benefit unbanked populations in Mexico, India and Indonesia. Citing centuries-old informal Latin American financial traditions, the paper argued that cryptocurrency companies can “build upon and digitize” practices that “assist in the creation of wealth for poor communities and allow them to thrive in locations deemed unprofitable by traditional banking standards”. But recent cryptocurrency disasters cast doubt on this vision. Last month, Terra, a so-called “stablecoin” that used an algorithm to maintain a peg to the US dollar suddenly cratered, making billions of dollars’ worth of digital tokens worthless – and taking countless investors’ fortunes along with it. Since May, the price of bitcoin – the first cryptocurrency – has nearly halved as well, as more investors flee digital assets. Crypto companies have been laying off hundreds of staff. The Bitcoin Academy spokesperson acknowledged the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, but said it wouldn’t hinder the course at Marcy Houses, which would be focused on financial education. The instructors, Wilson and Roberts, did not respond to requests for comment. Even some local cryptocurrency fans remain skeptical. Gerald, a Brooklyn resident with friends and family living at Marcy who declined to give his last name, runs a small charity that gives people bitcoin. But even he said that “financial literacy” wouldn’t solve Marcy’s “biggest issue, which is a lack of capital, a lack of resources, and a lack of funding for our communities”. “Teaching someone about bitcoin that doesn’t even have $100 in their savings account is not helpful,” he told the Guardian via social media. “Then of all places to do it in Marcy Projects?! Those people are just trying to survive and see the next day.” To Gerald, the image of Bitcoin Academy flyers strewn on the floor spoke volumes. “The fact that it was on the floor like that. It honestly symbolizes how people feel about poor people in general. On the surface, it looks like folks want to help, but once you start peeling back the layers, you realize nobody really cares.”","publicationTime":1655442002.000000000,"title":"Jay-Z’s bitcoin school met with skepticism in his former housing project: ‘I don’t have money to be losing’","id":"music/2022/jun/17/jay-z-bitcoin-school-marcy-houses"},{"body":"The defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX has recovered $7.3bn (£5.8bn) of customer funds and could be restarted as a going concern as soon as next year, the company’s lawyers have said. “The situation has stabilised, and the dumpster fire is out,” its attorney Andy Dietderich said during a hearing at a Delaware bankruptcy court. FTX spectacularly collapsed in November, triggering a “crypto winter”. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was later arrested and extradited from the Bahamas to the US. In mid-November, when FTX filed for bankruptcy, the company had collected just $3.3bn of assets to distribute among stakeholders. Recovery efforts have more than doubled that figure so far, court filings show, including $800m in recovered cash and a further $600m in “settlements and investments receivable”. But the biggest sum has been in “category A crypto” tokens with large and liquid markets. FTX now has more than $4bn of crypto assets under its control, a total that has been bolstered by a sharp recovery in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, which had dropped below $20,000 after FTX’s collapse, this week broke $30,000 for the first time since June 2022 , with other cryptocurrencies including ethereum charting a similar course. That price increase has put more than $1bn back in the coffers of FTX, court filings show. The company plans to complete an assessment of the possibility of restarting the exchange by the end of the June, and ultimately confirm its goals within a year after that date. But Dietderich said the actual customer shortfall remained unknown, according to a court report from Reuters. The company’s legal team is still working to accurately recreate internal records of FTX’s accounts, and external estimates from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission put missing funds at more than $8bn. Other FTX funds are still locked up in the Bahamas, where the Caribbean country’s own securities commission seized assets related to the winding-up of the company’s local subsidiary. The ensuing tussle over jurisdiction between FTX’s US-based legal team and the Bahamian regulators has yet to be resolved, but the bulk of the assets at stake are FTX’s in-house FTT token. The token, which is thinly traded and largely valued based on the health of FTX itself, has a supposed market value in the billions, but the company’s US team dispute that, arguing that its true value is as low as $170m. FTX could recover further funds by selling subsidiaries such as Japanese exchange FTX Japan, which were largely ringfenced from the parent company and have continued to operate with only brief pauses during the bankruptcy process. In a court filing from Sunday, FTX’s new administration admitted it was having to comb through QuickBooks and Slack chats to uncover the company’s financial position. “Approximately 80,000 transactions were simply left as unprocessed accounting entries in catch-all QuickBooks accounts titled Ask My Accountant,” the filing says. “Further complicating matters, QuickBooks entries were often made months after transactions occurred, rendering impossible real-time financial reporting and risk management.”","publicationTime":1681386133.000000000,"title":"FTX could be revived as more customers’ funds recovered, say lawyers","id":"business/2023/apr/13/ftx-customers-funds-recovered-cryptocurrency-exchange"},{"body":"In Budapest, there is a bust by the Danube River. The face is bronze, and blank, so people can see their own faces reflected back at them. It is wearing a hoodie, with the bitcoin logo on the chest. It is a statue of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is the person or persons who developed bitcoin. They are anonymous and pseudonymous. They created a decentralised, digital commodity which is now worth more than a trillion dollars globally. It is a peer-to-peer way of transferring money, skipping the banks. It’s encrypted with blockchain technology, which creates digital signatures to prove where the bitcoin has come from. You may have heard about Australian Craig Wright, who has been in the news recently thanks to a court case in the US. Wright is an influential entrepreneur. He might be Nakamoto. But he also might not. It is a mystery he could, in theory, solve in seconds (more of that later). This week Wright was fighting claims from the family of his deceased business partner, David Kleiman, that the pair co-created bitcoin. Therefore, they argued, half of more than $50bn of the original bitcoin belonged to them. Wright won the battle – a Florida jury found he did not owe the money. His lawyers said the pair were friends who worked together, but that their partnership was nothing to do with bitcoin’s creation. But behind that court case is a bigger story. Those bitcoin could only be owned by someone who was involved with the venture from the beginning – Nakamoto. Wright says he is Nakamoto, and Nakamoto is accepted as the creator of bitcoin. And to prove he is Nakamoto, Wright needs to show he controls some of those original bitcoin. Bitcoin expert Dr David Glance, a University of Western Australia computer scientist, says such a feat would be akin to King Arthur pulling Excalibur from stone. A proof of rightful ownership. “If you’re going to prove you are who you say you are, you just have to prove you have that key (to the bitcoin),” he says. “You don’t have to spend it, just move it from one account to another.” Of course, he says, it’s possible that Wright, or Nakamoto (or whoever he/she/they is/are) could have lost that key. Earlier this year the New York Times reported that as much as $140bn worth of bitcoin is lost to people who have forgotten or misplaced their keys. A UK man, Stefan Thomas, is one person who forgot his password, which would unlock hundreds of millions of dollars. When you create bitcoin, Glance says, it’s there, it’s available, it’s owned by the person who “mined” it. (Essentially huge amounts of computer power are used to solve algorithms to create new bitcoins.) That person then has the key to that bitcoin. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Up until 2010, Nakamato was active online, discussing the development of bitcoin. They published their workings from the time of bitcoin’s conception, the bitcoin “white paper”, in 2008. Nakamoto shared plenty of their work, then went to ground just over a decade ago, only to pop up occasionally. Since then, around the world, amateur sleuths and computer experts and many others have been trying to work out who Nakamoto was – or is. Because whoever created bitcoin is an extremely rich person, and the enigma is an appealing story. In 2014, a triumphant media pinpointed Japanese-American man Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the Nakamoto, tailing him through Los Angeles. Cornered by reporters outside his home, the slightly disheveled man said he hadn’t heard of bitcoin before being contacted by the media, and asked about a free lunch. Later a post by a “Satoshi Nakamoto” popped up online, declaring they were not Dorian. Then they disappeared again. In 2015 various reports pointed to 45-year-old Australian Craig Steven Wright as being Nakamoto. “Probably”. Journalists had traced Wright’s online history back to 2008, and found various links that hinted Wright was set to release a cryptocurrency back then and an email that used the Nakamoto name but had Wright’s phone number. The Guardian reported the email discussed the possibility of lobbying then Australian senator Arthur Sinodinos about bitcoin regulation. Nakamoto made another appearance, saying he wasn’t Wright. Other names have been bandied about, including that of entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose tweets about cryptocurrency have the ability to see its value rise and fall.(Musk denied it.) But it’s still Wright who is the most-oft-speculated-about candidate for Nakamoto. And the recent court case centred around the claims of Kleiman’s family, who say Kleiman – who died in 2013 – was the co-creator of bitcoin. Glance says whoever Nakamoto is, it is someone who has mined a lot of the early bitcoin, which now just sits there on the blockchain, gathering metaphorical digital dust. Who is Craig Wright? Wright is a computer scientist. A website purporting to be his says he is the “creator of bitcoin – Satoshi Nakamoto”. It describes him as: “(An) eternal student and researcher. (Blockchain company) nChain chief scientist. Lawyer, banker, economist, pastor, coder, investor, mathematician, stats, and world-curious.” A 2015 Guardian article points to his LinkedIn page, which shows he has a PhD from Charles Sturt University, and a host of other academic qualifications. He was involved in various computer firms, and was the director of more than a dozen companies. He has had his share of previous legal trouble, and in 2016 his rented Sydney home was raided by the Australian federal police in a tax-related matter. At the time a police spokesperson said it was not related to any claims he was behind bitcoin. He was reportedly moving to London with his wife. That same year (2016) Wright promised he would offer proof that he was Nakamoto by transferring bitcoin from early in its creation, something only the creator of the entire cryptocurrency could do, because of the way the digital signature shows the history of the bitcoin transactions. He said he would present “extraordinary proof”. Just days later, he wiped that pledge from the internet, and replaced it with a message that said: “I’m sorry.” He did not have the courage to leave the shelter of anonymity, he said, but he didn’t say he wasn’t Nakamoto. What happened in court? In Florida, Kleiman’s family brought a civil case against Wright, claiming it was owed half of 1.1m bitcoin created at the start of the bitcoin enterprise. That bitcoin had to have been mined by someone who was there at the beginning, such as Nakamoto. And the family says Kleiman was with him at the beginning. That 1.1m bitcoin is now worth about $50bn. Experts testified that Wright owned the bitcoin, and he successfully defended himself against Kleiman’s family, although he had to pay out $100m in intellectual property rights. If the jury had found that Wright owed half to Kleiman, Wright would have had to transfer the bitcoin to Kleiman’s family, which would have proven he was Nakamoto. But they didn’t find that, so it remains a mystery (unless Wright uses the earmarked bitcoin to pay the $100m). Why does everyone care so much about bitcoin, and its origin? Many banks are starting to offer cryptocurrency trades, which is unsurprising considering the interest in them, but also seemingly contradicts the notion of having a currency that bypasses financial institutions. Even the Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, has signalled an interest in a retail form of cryptocurrency, although he doesn’t foresee them being used in general purpose payments. Bitcoin is the most widely used and well-known cryptocurrency. Once a fringe idea, more than 100 million people worldwide now use it. But bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are extremely volatile. Their value fluctuates wildly, so Glance says you won’t be able to buy a cup of coffee with them because the price would go wildly up and down. “The cryptocurrency world is full of colourful people with big imaginations,” he says. “The idea of it taking over the world hasn’t transpired.” It has, however, found a couple of niches. “It’s fuelling most of the cybercrime we’re seeing today,” he says. “And you can use it to buy drugs online, to extort people, to hire contract killers.” But you can speculate on it, as you would with shares, although Glance says it’s effectively gambling. The other reason he steers clear is the environmental impact needed for the immense computer power that creates it. Research shows creating bitcoin alone could create a carbon footprint the size of London’s. “(And) it has absolutely no intrinsic value,” Glance says. “It’s just a lot of people subscribing to a Ponzi scheme.” Most people will happily live their lives never using bitcoin. But it’s still an extraordinary mystery that somewhere out there is a person (or there are persons) who have shifted financial markets, and helped people make enormous fortunes. Or sent them bust.","publicationTime":1639162848.000000000,"title":"Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright and a bitcoin mystery in America","id":"technology/2021/dec/11/satoshi-nakamoto-craig-wright-and-a-bitcoin-mystery-in-america"},{"body":"On 15 September, the ethereum blockchain is planning to switch off its mining rigs. If it happens, it should reduce the carbon emissions of the entire ethereum ecosystem by orders of magnitude overnight, leaving bitcoin as the only major cryptocurrency to be built on the destructive proof-of-work concept. But the switchover could also throw some of the largest institutions in the sector into chaos, and seems likely to evolve into a cold war between the new version of ethereum and the diehard followers of the old. And that’s if it happens at all. A brief refresher on cryptocurrencies. The two biggest in the world, ethereum and bitcoin, are based on an idea called proof of work. This – and I’m simplifying – involves the networks outsourcing their security to a decentralised network of miners, who compete to burn ludicrous amounts of electrical energy to generate lottery tickets. Each time a winning lottery ticket is generated, the miner who did so gets a reward (for bitcoin, that is currently 6.25BTC – about £110,000), and gets to verify all the transactions that have happened since the last winner, packaging them up into a neat block, and adding them on to the chain made up of all previous blocks. They stamp the block with their lottery number and the process begins again. Nearly all of the above paragraph is false, so please do not write to me. It is true enough for what follows: this proof-of-work model is at the root of everything you’ve heard about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. And ethereum is planning to drop it. The replacement is called proof of stake. Conceptually, it is more complex, but with the same broad brushstrokes we can describe it like this: rather than burning electricity to generate lottery tickets, you instead use your ethereum to buy premium bonds, and the system picks a winner in proportion to the amount of bonds they’ve bought, who then gets to do all the validation stuff as normal. You can cash out of your premium bonds, but the process is slow, so you are motivated not to abuse your validation privileges. A version of ethereum has been running on those principles for a while. It’s had different names over the years, from testnet to Eth2, but on 15 September it’s going to become simply ethereum. This switchover, dubbed “the merge” – because the old and the new networks will be merged together – has a good shot at being the single largest technological event ever to happen in the crypto space. Which means it has a good shot at being messy as hell. To start, there’s the date. If you’ve noticed a soupçon of scepticism, it’s because I’ve been burned before. I wrote about the forthcoming merge being “months away” – in May 2021: The switch to proof of stake has been planned for several years, with a host of problems, both technical and organisational, delaying implementation. But now, according to Carl Beekhuizen, a research and development staffer at the Ethereum Foundation … the change will be complete “in the upcoming months”. It was not. But this time, the switch is rather more final. For one thing, there’s an actual hard date; for another, the preparation for the merge is now live in the code that runs the ethereum network. It could still be delayed, but the default case, if no further action is taken, is that the merge will happen as planned. What’s at stake That doesn’t mean the merge will be smooth. The first stumbling block will be the forks: clones of the old version of ethereum, spun up to keep the proof of work system alive. This won’t be the first time this has happened. There’s untold bitcoin forks, with names like bitcoin cash, bitcoin satoshi vision, bitcoin classic and bitcoin gold, but none have ever toppled the original’s dominance. So why might the ethereum fork have more of a chance? Because it will almost certainly have the backing of a powerful constituency: ethereum miners. After years at the centre of ethereum infrastructure, the miners face their industry being simply switched off overnight, and many of them aren’t happy with that proposal. They have real, physical assets invested in the continuation of a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, from expensive graphics cards to electrical hookups, and it’s not easy to repurpose it for something else. Due to the open-source nature of cryptocurrencies, it’s easy enough for the miners to simply pick up where they left off, and carry on running Nu-thereum, or whatever it gets called, on 16 September as though the merge had never happened. The question is, what happens next? Everyone who has a balance of ETH will suddenly find that they have two balances, one on each blockchain. And everyone who has a smart contract running on ETH will suddenly find they have two of them, as well: there will be the proof-of-work version of the Bored Ape NFTs, and the proof-of-stake version, and so on. Some of those duplicates may happily coexist. Others might try to talk down the forked version, but never quite kill it – how much would someone who wants to own a killer NFT pay for an “unofficial” version on the forked chain? If it’s not zero, then the trade could continue for some time, even if the developers of the Apes disown the forks. But for other projects, there can only be one. Each USDC token is backed by $1 of hard assets held by Circle, the company that develops the stablecoin. If there are suddenly twice as many USDCs because of the fork, Circle doesn’t have twice as much cash, and it will have to choose one network to support and the other to reject. It seems unlikely that the big stablecoins, like USDC and Tether, will back the rebel chain. And that, in turn, means the entire rebel ecosystem will come into existence in a slow-motion collapse, as forked projects fail one by one. But it will still provide a base for new creation, and one that is ultimately more similar to the ethereum developers know and love than the environmentally friendly version it is about to morph into. What’s next The upstart miners aren’t solely acting out of self-interest. There is a point of principle at stake, as well, which is the decentralisation that underpins the crypto economy. That decentralisation is, at heart, the only real reason for cryptocurrencies to exist: a centralised conventional database is faster, cheaper and safer to run, but requires you to trust whoever is running it. A decentralised cryptocurrency can’t be interfered with by big business, or big government, which makes them great for – well, crime and evasion of government regulations, in the main, but also loftier concepts like “permissionless innovation” and “uncensorable speech”. Some of the backers of the proof-of-work (PoW) concept – including the bitcoin “maximalists” who look down even on upstarts like ethereum – worry that proof of stake (PoS) ultimately results in Dino: decentralisation in name only. The nature of the system involves handing control of the network to those with the most money held within the network. Worse, it hands extra power to those who look after other people’s money: centralised exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, and centralised notbanks like Celsius or Voyager, if they’d survived that long. Those exchanges can offer “staking” services where they do the hard technical bit of making proof of stake work (buying the premium bonds, in the terms of my fantastic analogy), and their customers get the rewards. The rise of the Dinos is more than just a theoretical concern. In a post-Tornado Cash world – still dealing with the fallout of North Korea’s favourite decentralised app being accused of money laundering and sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – it isn’t at all clear whether it is legal under US law for a “validator”, the PoS replacement for miners, to approve a block that contains a transaction to or from a sanctioned address. Ethereum’s developers are trying to force the matter, proposing a “credible commitment to punish censors”. What that means is not yet clear, but the hope is that it doesn’t have to be – that the credible commitment means that organisations who have to comply with OFAC simply do not stake ethereum in the first place. It is not entirely clear what an ethereum with no validators who are trying to remain in compliance with US sanctions would look like. But that is the world we’re heading to.

The value of the cryptocurrency rose above $68,000 in November and had been predicted to move even higher by the end of the year, amid concern about the value of traditional assets such as gold and government debt. Some investors and analysts, including the Wall Street bank JP Morgan, have also seen bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, which has begun to take off in large economies including the UK and the US. But the world’s largest digital currency, which had reached a total market value of $1.1tn before the weekend’s fall, has struggled to maintain momentum since reaching last month’s all-time high. Bitcoin began to slump markedly on Saturday, falling 22% from $53,890 to a temporary intraday low of $41,967 before recovering ground. On Monday, it was trading at $48,600, its lowest level since October. The cryptocurrency has been volatile in recent months but remains many times more valuable than it was five years ago, when investors could pick up a single coin for $700. Analysts at UBS bank blamed the weekend’s slump on various factors including uncertainty before the bosses of cryptocurrency exchanges are due to face questioning from a US congressional committee on Wednesday. “Crypto is often held up by proponents as a useful portfolio inflation hedge, but wild swings like what we saw this weekend back our view that is more akin to a highly speculative risk asset,” the analysts said. “Regulation remains a key overhang, and this unruly unwind and its impact on retail participants may add to the regulatory conversation.” Analysts at AJ Bell said bitcoin had endured its “latest thumping”. As bitcoin fell, so did other “altcoins” such as Ethereum, worth more than $4,600 on Friday evening but down to just above $4,000 on Monday afternoon. Bitcoin emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, allowing people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods. It has become the most prominent among thousands of cryptocurrencies. It relies on “blockchain” technology, which is a shared database of transactions with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. The network is secured by individuals called “miners” who use high-powered computers to verify transactions, with bitcoins offered as a reward. There are more than 18m bitcoins, and the mathematical system controlling the generation of new coins – which is decentralised and therefore has no overarching institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.","publicationTime":1638800034.000000000,"title":"Almost $12,000 wiped off value of bitcoin in weekend ‘thumping’","id":"technology/2021/dec/06/almost-dollars-12000-wiped-off-bitcoin-value-cryptocurrency"},{"body":"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency. From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices. “There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities. The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide. The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government. The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades. There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale. But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh). Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs. Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”. “We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.” Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry. In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. “It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel. Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?” Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective. Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware. While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain. “There are a lot of people who have invested in crypto mining equipment and it’s not a small investment,” cryptoKapo said. “People have even taken out loans to invest and the impact now is very bad on their lives.”","publicationTime":1642321846.000000000,"title":"Panic as Kosovo pulls the plug on its energy-guzzling bitcoin miners ","id":"technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners"},{"body":"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its chief executive are being sued by the US’s top financial watchdog, which has accused them of making billions of dollars while “placing investors’ assets at significant risk”. In a court filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Binance of mixing “billions of dollars” in customer funds and secretly sending them to a separate company controlled by its founder and chief executive, Changpeng Zhao. “We allege that Zhao and the Binance entities not only knew the rules of the road, but they also consciously chose to evade them and put their customers and investors at risk,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. In its complaint filed on Monday at a federal district court in Washington, the SEC added: “Defendants have enriched themselves by billions of US dollars while placing investors’ assets at significant risk.” The complaint alleges that between June 2018 and July 2021, Binance earned at least $11.6bn (£9.3bn) in revenue, mostly from transaction fees. Among other charges, the SEC alleges that, while Zhao and Binance publicly claimed that US customers were restricted from transacting on Binance.com, “Zhao and Binance in reality subverted their own controls to secretly allow high-value US customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform”. The 13 civil charges have been placed against Zhao, Binance Holdings and two further Binance-linked entities, BAM Trading Services and BAM Management US Holdings. The SEC said Binance and BAM operated the Binance.US platform, which had been created for US customers after the main Binance platform said in 2019 it was quitting the US market. The SEC alleges that, while Zhao and Binance publicly claimed that Binance.US was created as a separate, independent trading platform for US investors, “Zhao and Binance secretly controlled the Binance.US platform’s operations behind the scenes”. The SEC alleges that Zhao and Binance were able to commingle or divert customers assets “as they please” including to a Zhao-controlled entity called Sigma Chain. The regulator claims that Sigma also engaged in “manipulative trading” that artificially inflated trading volume on Binance.US. The SEC also charged Binance and BAM Trading with operating unregistered securities exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies, as well as the unregistered offering and sale of crypto assets including the Binance USD stablecoin, a digital token whose value is pegged to the American dollar. It alleged that Zhao was a “control person” for the unregistered exchange operation. The SEC complaint alleges that Zhao directed Binance to conceal the access of high-spending US customers to Binance.com. In one piece of evidence included in the lawsuit, the Binance chief compliance officer messaged a colleague saying: “We are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.” Elsewhere in the lawsuit Binance’s CCO is quoted as saying: “We do not want [Binance].com to be regulated ever.” A Binance spokesperson said: “We want to be clear that while we take the allegations in the SEC’s complaint seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an expedited basis. They are unjustified.” John Stark, a former senior SEC official and senior lecturing fellow at Duke University’s school of law, said the SEC has been “incredibly aggressive” towards the crypto industry recently, having announced more than 30 cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions since 2022. Stark added that the complaint contained “scathing allegations” including evidence that Binance’s actions were “designed to avoid regulatory scrutiny”. In March the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and Zhao in a complaint that claimed the defendants committed “wilful evasion of US law”. Allegations in the complaint included claims that Binance helped US customers trade on the platform despite not having regulatory clearance to do so. Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, fell as much as 6% on the news to its lowest in almost three months. Binance’s own cryptocurrency BNB, the world’s fourth-largest by market size, dropped more than 5%. Market players said the SEC’s allegations could hobble Binance, with the lawsuit likely to reverberate through the crypto industry. Binance dominates crypto trading, processing trades worth about $65bn a day last year.

The 31-year-old fraudster was offered bail on Valentine’s Day, releasing her from incarceration while her husband, Ilya “Dutch” Liechtenstein, remains in federal bondage. Morgan is at the centre of a psychedelic cryptocurrency saga, that began when the pair were arrested on suspicion of laundering $4.5bn worth of stolen bitcoin. That money was originally pilfered from a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange firm called Bitfinex, and it breaks the record for the most digital currency that’s ever been seized by a criminal sting operation. (The pair allegedly spent the money on NFTs, gold and a Walmart gift card.) It’s the first major crime saga of the Web3 era – Blockchain noir, ripe for a Safdie Brothers film – and each twist in the storyline is more implausible than the last. But who is this Bitcoin crime queen and what does she tell us about the future of organized crime and the stark new inequalities that it might create? The money that Morgan and Lichtenstein are accused of laundering was originally pilfered six years ago, and honestly it’s a minor miracle that the Department of Justice was capable of digging it up in the first place as crypto is notoriously difficult to recover. So far they have seized $3.6bn. So if you are already the sort of person who might be seduced by the grifter’s lifestyle, cryptocurrency is a natural hideout point. Everything about this case is more evidence of the worryingly psychotropic texture our monetary system has taken on in 2022 – a year when late-night hosts are dropping thousands of dollars on cartoon apes and YouTube prankster Logan Paul is making $20m per boxing match. It is hard to articulate how it feels to be alive in an age of massive wealth disparity and multiple deregulatory lines of questionable crypto minting, but I think watching an alleged Bitcoin embezzler struggle through painful rap bars in a flat-billed cap that reads “0 FCKS” is a good summation of the overwhelming confusion. Let’s begin with the many layers of Heather Morgan’s business portfolio. It turns out that when The Crime Queen of Bitcoin is not conducting her digital heists, she’s also an ascendent TikTokker, a self-help YouTuber, an economic columnist and most impressively, an amateur rapper. The alias she uses for her artistic ventures: “Razzlekhan.” After her arrests, the world was briefly subsumed by Razzlekhan’s mesmerizing public brand as reporters around the world splunked through the tranches of content left behind in Morgan’s wake. In one memorable music video, she gallivants through Wall Street in John Lennon sunglasses and a leopard-print scarf, ready for a fight. “I’ve got pallid blood, I’m a real risk-taker,” she rhymes in the shadow of a bronze George Washington statue. There’s also a 14-minute YouTube soliloquy where Razzlekhan doles out higher-education advice. “I’m not trust fund,” she says. “My parents both work for the government. I’ve been totally broke and homeless. Money, in my mind, comes goes. Sometimes you have it and sometimes you don’t.” She makes no reference as to the exact nature in which she found herself with money. Morgan was upfront about her financial avarice in a column she wrote for Inc. in 2021 entitled: 4 First-Time Founder Mistakes to Avoid at All Costs, Morgan asks readers to remember that your desire to hustle should never run dry. “The first million dollars in revenue is so exciting,” she wrote. “But once you hit that, you’re thinking about how to get to $5m, $10m, and suddenly $100m.” At one point she asks her viewers to consider a goal, and find the “easiest path” to achieve it. Pinned to the top of her Twitter page is a quote that is erroneously attributed to Winston Churchill: “You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something in your life.” It is unsurprising that Morgan surfaced within the burgeoning blockchain underground.She embodies a ubiquitous type in the world of crypto – the chronically posting hustle-entrepreneur who has consolidated every available publicity stunt and duplicitous business undertaking within reach to brute-force a hollow, demi-influencer’s subsistence. To think that those music videos might’ve been funded by freshly laundered crypto credit is ghoulishly predictable. The couple is “a perfect synecdoche for everything anyone doesn’t like about an attention economy in which anything can be financialized”, argues Vice in their investigation into her rap career. Unsurprisingly, this week also brought news that Netflix was already hard at work on a docuseries about the couple. Who knows? Maybe Razzlekhan is destined to become the next Tiger King. Heather Morgan and Dutch Liechtenstein have not pleaded guilty. Their defense attorney has taken an adversarial stance in the proceedings thus far, claiming that the government’s case is “thin.” So perhaps normalcy will return, justice will be served and the world can breathe easy knowing that a mediocre rapper and her husband are not capable of participating in the largest crypto heist in human history. But for now we do not have that privilege and I think that’s why everyone keeps tumbling down the Razzlekhan rabbit hole. The lasting legacy of Morgan and Lichtenstein may be that they’ve killed the image we hold of a criminal kingpin in our heads. It’s been a long time since the mob ran New York City, in part because traditional organized crime, with its body counts, turf wars and punitive sentencing measures, is far too risky for the expected gains. In their stead, we have received a generation of crypto eccentrics who have moved operations to the arctic regions of the American economy. The blockchain was always going to attract the most unbridled dreamers of the population, and now we are watching one of them morph into a supervillain dressed in leather pants and a flight jacket, calling themselves the Turkish Martha Stewart in some of the worst hip-hop ever recorded. As we get deeper into our uncertain metaversal future I expect that the rise and fall of figures like Morgan will become increasingly common. There are so many skeletons lingering in the closets of Manhattan high-rises, especially the ones lined with Bitcoin.

So he did what millions of amateur investors have done in recent years: he turned to cryptocurrency. “It was impossible and unsafe to store funds in the form of banknotes. There was a big risk of theft, we also had cases of looting. Therefore, I trusted a ‘stable and reliable’ cryptocurrency. Not for the purpose of speculating, but simply to save,” he says. The digital asset that Popovich chose in April was terra, a “stablecoin” whose value was supposed to be pegged to the dollar. It collapsed in May, sparking a rout in the cryptocurrency market whose victims include Popovich. He lost $10,000 (£8,200). Popovich says his losses were “devastating”, although donations from sympathetic onlookers on social media have helped make up some of the shortfall. He says: “I stopped sleeping normally, lost 4kg, I often have headaches and anxiety.” Popovich is one of many experiencing the deep chill of the current crypto winter, more than four years after the market’s cornerstone, bitcoin, marked the first digital freeze by tumbling from its then peak. It went on a long tear after that but it has come to a juddering halt, with bitcoin falling below the $20,000 mark at one point this month – far below its peak of nearly $69,000, which it hit last November. The fall has been sharp and spectacular: an overall market that was estimated to be worth more than $3tn barely six months ago is now worth less than $1tn. Crypto boom: a new digital economy The beginnings of the latest crypto boom held all the hallmarks of being another instance of the “Robinhood economy”, named after the popular American stock trading app. Bored white collar workers, stuck at home because of pandemic lockdowns but awash with disposable income, turned to day trading as a way to pass the time. Subscribers to the r/WallStreetBets forum on the popular online discussion site Reddit doubled over the course of 2020 and then quadrupled in the first month of 2021, as a small army of retail investors flooded into assets as varied as the then bankrupt car rental company Hertz, the troubled video game retailer GameStop and the electric car manufacturer Tesla, pushing the latter from $85 at the beginning of the pandemic to a high of $1,243 towards the end of 2021. Cryptocurrencies also benefited from the surge in day trading. Bitcoin soared from a low of $5,000 in March 2020 to more than $60,000 a year later. The currency has had that sort of precipitous increase before: in 2017, it had risen 20-fold, to its then peak of $19,000. But in the latest boom, ethereum, the number two cryptocurrency, had an even more impressive climb, from just $120 to a high of almost $5,000 in 2021. Cryptocurrency is the name for any digital asset that works like bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, which was invented in 2009. There is a “decentralised ledger”, which records who owns what, built into a “blockchain”, which secures the whole network by ensuring transactions are irreversible once made. In the years since then, a dizzying amount of variations have arisen, but the core – the blockchain concept – is remarkably stable, in part because of the social implications of truly decentralised networks being immune to government oversight or regulation. Where, 10 years ago, people simply spoke of trading in bitcoin, the space has ballooned. As well as cryptocurrencies themselves, , the sector has developed in a complex ecosystem. It encompasses Web3, a broader selection of apps and services built on top of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, an attempt to bootstrap an entire financial sector out of code rather than contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which use the same technology as cryptocurrencies to trade in objects rather than money. The flood of money washing into the world of crypto did more than simply inflate the paper wealth of pre-existing shareholders. Instead, it led to a surge of interest in, and funding for, the vast array of projects that aimed to capitalise on the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. For a generation of new investors, the “decentralised finance” opportunities of the sector were appealing. Built on top of the “programmable money” of the ethereum cryptocurrency, the “DeFi” [decentralised finance] sector is an attempt to expand bitcoin’s anti-establishment ethos to cover the entire economy. Take the comparatively small sector of the crypto market known as NFTs. A product dating back to 2014, NFTs take the tech used to create cryptocurrencies, but let creators link unique assets to the blockchain, instead of money-like currencies. That means NFTs can be traded that represent works of art, virtual collectibles, or even function as tickets to events or membership of clubs. And like cryptocurrencies, they can be bought or sold in open exchanges, held pseudonymously, and packaged up or securitised in complex financial instruments. A boom within a boom, individual NFTs sold for silly amounts of money in mid-2021. One token, representing years of work by the digital artist Beeple, sold for $69m; another, linked to the first tweet sent by the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, was bought for $2.9m. Individual NFTs in the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection – the most consistently desired examples of “profile pic” NFTs, designed to be used as pre-packaged online identity – regularly sold for $1m-$3m apiece. But by the beginning of 2022, the NFT bubble appeared to have already popped. “Floor” prices for large NFT collections had plummeted, and, while many large NFT acquisitions have stayed in private collection, those that have been put back on the market have fared poorly: the Dorsey tweet was withdrawn from sale after achieving a top bid of just $14,000. And then: the crash The crypto crisis has played out against the backdrop of wider market problems, as fears over the Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and higher borrowing costs stalk investors. Some market watchers play down the prospect of a crypto crash triggering serious problems elsewhere in the financial markets or the global economy. The total value of all cryptocurrencies is about $1tn currently (with bitcoin accounting for about 40% of the total), which compares with approximately $100tn for the world’s stock markets. Since November the value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen from $3tn, meaning that $2tn worth of wealth has been wiped out, with no serious knock-on effects to the broader stock market – so far. Teunis Brosens, the head economist for digital finance at the Dutch bank ING, says the traditional financial system is relatively well shielded because established banks – the cornerstones of the financial world that buckled in 2008 – are not exposed to cryptocurrencies because they do not hold digital assets on their balance sheets, unlike during the financial crisis when they held toxic debt products related to the housing market. “What has happened in the crypto market has caused great losses for some investors and it’s all very painful and not something I want to downplay,” he says. “But it would be overplaying the role that crypto currently has in the economic and financial system if you were to think there could be systemic consequences for the wider financial system or even a global recession directly caused by crypto assets.” To date, the turmoil has been limited to the crypto sector. Digital assets have been hit by some of the same economic issues that have affected the wider global economy and stock markets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been affected by concerns over rising inflation and the ensuing increases in interest rates by central banks, which has made risky assets less attractive to investors. This meant that as stock markets declined, so too did crypto assets. But the collapse last month of terra also hit confidence in cryptocurrencies. In June, a cryptocurrency lender, Celsius, was forced to stop customer withdrawals. And a hedge fund that made big bets on the crypto markets slid towards liquidation. Crypto investors and firms that had made bets on the crypto market using digital assets as collateral were forced into a selling spree. Kim Grauer, the head of research at the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis, says: “It was a combination of the stock market plus the kind of excessive reaction that is typical of crypto markets because of these cascading liquidations. In this case the key event was terra.” She added: “Crypto is not going away. And it has experienced crashes more severe than this crash.” Regulators and various government agencies are looking closely. Harry Eddis, the global co-head of fintech at Linklaters, a London-based law firm, says recent events in the crypto asset market will strengthen regulators’ determination to rein in the industry. “I think it will certainly stiffen the sinews of the regulators in saying that they’re more than justified in regulating the industry, because of the obvious risks with a lot of the crypto assets out there,” he says. In the UK, the financial watchdog continues to expand safeguards on crypto products. Its latest proposals on marketing crypto products to consumers could lead to significant restrictions on crypto exchanges operating in the UK. Consumers reported 4,300 potential crypto scams to the Financial Conduct Authority’s website over a six-month period last year, far ahead of the second place category, pension transfers, which had 1,600 reports. The FCA has 50 live investigations, including criminal inquiries, into companies in the sector. The terra collapse has also heightened regulatory concerns about stablecoins, because they are backed by traditional assets and therefore could pose a risk to the wider financial system. In the UK, the Treasury wants a regime in place for dealing with a stablecoin collapse, saying in May that a terra-like failure could endanger the “continuity of services critical to the operation of the economy and access of individuals to their funds or assets”. “Even just the top three stablecoins hold reserves totalling $140bn in traditional assets, much of this being in commercial paper and US treasuries. A run on redemptions of the largest coin (tether) could destabilise the entire crypto asset system and spill over into other markets,” says Carol Alexander, the professor of finance at University of Sussex Business School. Elsewhere, the EU is drawing up a regulatory framework for crypto assets with the aim of introducing it by 2024, while in the US Joe Biden has signed an executive order directing the federal government to coordinate a regulatory plan for cryptocurrencies including ensuring “sufficient oversight and safeguard against any systemic financial risks posed by digital assets”. The Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer watchdog, says 46,000 people have lost more than $1bn to crypto scams since the start of 2021. In general, regulators have been talking tough about cryptocurrencies. The chair of the FCA has called for “strong safeguards” to be put in place for the crypto market, while the head of the US financial regulator has warned consumers about crypto products promising returns that are “too good to be true”, while Singapore has said it will be “brutal and unrelentingly hard” on misbehaviour in the crypto market. ‘I’m sure crypto will bubble again’ Where crypto goes from here is an unanswerable question. For proponents, such as Changpeng Zhao, the multibillionaire owner of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, the sector is sure to recover – though it might take some time. “I think given this price drop … it will probably take a while to get back,” he told the Guardian last week. “It probably will take a few months or a couple of years.” For sceptics, however, the plummet could be a lasting wound. “Bitcoin will be around for decades,” says David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain. “All you need is the software, the blockchain and two or more enthusiasts. Unless there’s new stringent regulation, I’m sure crypto will bubble again. But if there’s a genuine consumer bubble, it may not reach the heights of this one. The 2021-22 bubble made it to the Super Bowl. As many a dotcom found out 20 years ago, there’s nowhere to go from there – you’ve reached every consumer in America.” But one thing both sides agree on is that the dividing line between “survivable downturn” and “cryptoapocalypse” is likely to involve neither bitcoin nor ethereum, but the third biggest cryptocurrency: a stablecoin called tether. Stablecoins are a foundational part of the crypto ecosystem. Their value is fixed to that of a conventional currency, allowing users to cash out of risky positions without going through the rigamarole of a bank transfer, and enabling crypto-native banks and DeFi establishments to work without taking on a currency risk. In essence, stablecoins function like the banks of the crypto economy, allowing people to park their money safely in the knowledge that it is not exposed to wider risk. Which means that when a stablecoin collapses, it has a very similar effect to a bank failure: money disappears across the ecosystem, liquidity dries up, and other institutions begin to fail in a domino effect. The beginning of the latest crisis in crypto was sparked by exactly that: the failure of the terra/luna stablecoin. The algorithmic checks and balances put in place to keep it stable broke – triggering a death spiral. And so on 9 May, a stablecoin called UST “depegged”, dropping from $1 to $0.75 in a day, and then falling further, and further and further. Within four days, the luna blockchain was turned off entirely, the project declared dead. A domino effect took out other crypto establishments. Some of the “contagion” has been prevented, in part through huge loans made by Alameda Ventures, the investment arm of 30-year-old crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire. Drawing comparisons to JP Morgan in the panic of 1907, “SBF” has stepped in to support the crypto bank Voyager and the embattled exchange BlockFi, and been loudly calling for support from others. Unlike terra, tether is a “centralised” stablecoin, maintaining its value through reserves which, the company says, are always redeemable one-to-one for a tether token. The model means it cannot enter a “death spiral” like terra, but also means the stability of the token is entirely a function of how much one trusts tether to actually maintain its reserves. That trust is not a sure thing. Tether once claimed to hold all its reserves in “US dollars”, a claim that the New York attorney general’s office concluded in 2021 was “a lie”. Tether, and Bitfinex – a bitcoin exchange that shares an executive team with, but is legally distinct from, Tether – “recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines”, Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said at the time. The two companies had transferred money back and forth to cover up insolvency, she said, and had failed to ensure tether was “fully backed at all times”, the investigation concluded. “Tether has been the timebomb under the market since 2017,” says Gerard. “It has reduced its market cap by 15bn USDT in the last month, and has claimed that these are redemptions, or a reduction in their holdings of ‘commercial paper’,” she says, referring to one of the key assets that Tether uses on its balance sheet: commercial paper, short-term debt issued by banks and corporations to cover immediate funding needs. Tether, for its part, remains extremely bullish – and has even suggested it may publish a formal audit of its reserves, something it said was “months away” in August 2021. In late June, Tether announced another expansion: the introduction of the first GBP stablecoin. “We believe that the UK is the next frontier for blockchain innovation and the wider implementation of cryptocurrency for financial markets,” says Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether and Bitfinex. “Tether is ready and willing to work with UK regulators to make this goal a reality.” More regulation, and further market volatility, are a given. Popovich says he is still receiving donations. “I’m extremely embarrassed. Yesterday an anonymous person sent me $50 in the form of cryptocurrency. And I’ve never borrowed anything from anyone in my life. I’m scared and restless.”","publicationTime":1656520883.000000000,"title":"Crypto crisis: how digital currencies went from boom to collapse","id":"technology/2022/jun/29/crypto-crisis-digital-currencies-boom-collapse-bitcoin-terra"},{"body":"The human cost of El Salvador’s controversial “war on gangs” has been laid bare in a new report which claims dozens of prisoners were tortured and killed in jail after being caught up in the year-long security crackdown. The detailed 107-page report from human rights group Cristosal said at least 153 people had died in custody after being arrested as part of President Nayib Bukele’s year-long offensive against the Central American country’s notorious “pandillas”. The NGO said it had confirmed 29 of those fatalities as violent deaths and another 46 were considered suspicious. In most of those 75 cases, Cristosal said the bodies of the victims showed signs of torture, beatings or strangulation. Other dead inmates also showed signs of injuries but were classified as having died of “undetermined” or “natural” causes meaning the true number of violent deaths could be higher. The report came as one of Bukele’s predecessors as president, Mauricio Funes, was sentenced in absentia to 14 years in jail for allegedly negotiating with the gangs during his 2009-2014 administration. The rights group, Cristosal, said it had obtained photographs and mortuary reports showing bodies with signs of “asphyxiation, [bone] fractures, significant bruising, lacerations and even perforations”. Some appeared to have died of malnutrition. Nearly half of the victims were men aged between 18 and 38. The NGO claimed some prisoners had been tortured with electric shocks. Cristosal’s director, Noah Bullock, said its findings highlighted how human rights violations were “a systematic practice rather than an exception” under El Salvador’s current government. The human rights group based its report on interviews with dozens of relatives of the deceased and former inmates, as well as official forensic reports and field work. El Salvador’s government has rejected criticism of its anti-gang campaign, which has seen more than 67,000 people arrested since its began in March 2022. It dismisses critical NGOs and media organizations as defenders of gangs and “terrorists”. North American crypto enthusiasts have championed El Salvador’s bitcoin-loving authoritarian leader and his gang clampdown, as have rightwing populists in other Latin American countries struggling with violent crime. Even government critics admit the crackdown – which looks set to guarantee Bukele a second term in next year’s presidential election – has brought dramatic change to poor Salvadorian communities which for years lived under the brutal rule of gangs. “The dismantling of gangs has enormous life-changing potential for the country,” the trailblazing news outlet El Faro reported earlier this year after chronicling the groups’ apparent dissolution in a 5,000-word investigation. “They have ruined the gangs as you knew them,” one senior gang boss told El Faro. However, those advances have come at a high cost for El Salvador’s democracy, human rights, civil liberties and the thousands of broken families whose members have been caught up in the government offensive. Vilma Mancía said she had been forced to raise her six grandchildren after both her two children, aged 22 and 29, were jailed during the crackdown. “Nobody helps me, not even to find food … I don’t know what to do,” said the 65-year-old from Apopa who was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer. Last year the Guardian documented the case of one young Salvadorian who died in mysterious circumstances shortly after being arrested in Salcoatitán, a tourist town in El Salvador’s coffee-growing heartlands. Juan José Ibáñez García – a 21-year-old restaurant worker who friends claimed had no links to crime – died last May, a fortnight after being arrested. “We had so many dreams … to be parents; to build a business together; to study together … and it’s all gone,” said his 23-year-old girlfriend, Sandra García, who admitted she had helped elect Bukele in 2019. “So many Salvadorians put our trust in [Bukele] – and we were cheated,” García added. The former president, Funes, has lived in exile in Nicaragua since 2019 meaning he cannot be taken into custody. He was reportedly sentenced to eight years in prison for illicit association and six for failure to perform his duties. Despite its crackdown on gangs, Bukele’s administration has also faced accusations of negotiating with the gangs, including US claims it sealed a secret truce with the leaders of the Barrio-18 and MS-13 groups. Bukele has denied those claims.","publicationTime":1685387822.000000000,"title":"At least 153 died in custody in El Salvador’s gang crackdown – report ","id":"world/2023/may/29/el-salvador-security-gangs-crackdown-cristosal-report-bukele"},{"body":"An episode of the Simpsons that references “forced labour camps” in China has been removed from Disney+ streaming services in Hong Kong. The episode is the second in the long-running US cartoon’s latest season. One Angry Lisa sees Marge buy an interactive training exercise bike, similar to a Peloton bike. On an interactive tour, the guide takes Marge to the Great Wall of China with its wonders of “bitcoin mines, forced labour camps where children make smartphones, and romance”. China’s government has long faced accusations of operating forced labour camps, particularly with Uyghur workers from the Xinjiang region. The Guardian has confirmed, as first reported by the Financial Times, that One Angry Lisa is not available in Hong Kong, with the streaming platform showing all other episodes from the season. The Walt Disney Co was contacted for comment. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), but until recently had maintained far greater cultural, political, and social freedoms. After a crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 2019, it has come under increasing control of the PRC government, with intensifying censorship of political expression. Media outlets, political parties, bookshops and libraries, human rights websites, museums, and children’s books have all been targeted by authorities hunting out anti-government sentiment. In 2021, Hong Kong’s legislature passed a film censorship law to “safeguard national security” but officials said at the time that the law did not apply to streaming services. The Hong Kong government said the film censorship law was aimed at content deemed to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”. One Angry Lisa is at least the second episode of the Simpsons to be made unavailable on official platforms in Hong Kong. When Disney+ launched in Hong Kong in November 2021, episode 12 of the 16th season was not included. In that episode the family visit Tiananmen Square and see a plaque reading “on this site, in 1989, nothing happened”. Tiananmen is the site of a deadly 1989 crackdown against pro-democracy protesters.

The announcement of charges against the two alleged agents came as the attorney general, Merrick Garland, detailed two other cases in which Chinese intelligence operatives harassed dissidents inside the United States and pressured US academics to work for them. Garland said that the cases showed that China “sought to interfere with the rights and freedoms of individuals in the United States and to undermine our judicial system that protects those rights. “The justice department will not tolerate attempts by any foreign power to undermine the rule of law upon which our democracy is based,” he said. Washington has long accused Beijing of meddling in US politics and attempting to steal intellectual property. But the move to unmask the espionage operation marked an escalation by the justice department after it accused Huawei in February 2020 of conducting racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets. “This was an egregious attempt by PRC intelligence officers to shield a PRC-based company from accountability and to undermine the integrity of our judicial system,” Garland said at a news conference unveiling the indictment. The Chinese intelligence officers Guochun He and Zheng Wang attempted to orchestrate a scheme to steal the prosecution strategy memo, witness lists, and other confidential evidence from the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of New York, the indictment said. The charging papers against He and Wang referred only to an unnamed telecommunications company based in China, but the entity in question is understood to be Huawei, according to a source familiar with the matter. According to the indictment unsealed in Brooklyn, the Chinese agents paid about $61,000 worth of bitcoin in bribes to a US government official whom they believed had been recruited to work for the Chinese government but in fact worked as a double agent for the FBI. The FBI double agent provided some documents to the Chinese agents that appeared to present some of the information they sought – though the documents were actually prepared by the justice department and did not reveal actual meetings or trial strategies. Starting in September 2021, the indictment said, He and Wang asked the FBI double agent about what he learned from the US attorney’s office in New York, and which Huawei employees had been interviewed by federal prosecutors as a way to gain insight into the case. The following month, the FBI double agent sent them a document made to look like an internal strategy memo that was labelled “Secret” and discussed a plan to charge and arrest two Huawei employees living in China, for which He is alleged to have paid $41,000 in bitcoin bribes. The initial bribe was followed with a second payment of $20,000 in bitcoin from He as a “reward” in September 2022, the indictment said. US law enforcement officials have long warned about national security threats posed by China, including through human and cyber espionage, as part of increasingly brazen attempts to steal corporate intellectual property, trade secrets and influence US policy. “The cases unsealed today take place against a backdrop of malign activity by the People’s Republic of China that includes espionage, harassment, obstruction of our justice system and unceasing efforts to steal US technology,” the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said. “China seeks to be a major power on the world stage and challenge the United States in multiple arenas. Today’s cases make clear that Chinese agents will not hesitate to break the law and to violate international norms in the process,” Monaco said. Arrest warrants were issued for the two men, but it is unlikely they will ever be taken into custody. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though China and Huawei have both previously denied such allegations. He and Wang, understood to be based in China, could not be reached. At the news conference on Monday, Garland also announced a second indictment newly unsealed in New Jersey that charged three Chinese intelligence officers with conspiring to act as illegal agents between 2008 and 2018 under the cover of an academic institution. That indictment alleges the three intelligence officials had attempted to illegally ship US technology to China, as well as to undercut protests in the US that would have probably been embarrassing to the Chinese government. Separately two people were arrested and five others charged with harassing a US resident in order to force them to return to China. Part of the plot, prosecutors allege, involved having the person’s nephew travel to the US as part of a tour group to deliver threats that included, “Coming back and turning yourself in is the only way out.” Chinese agents have pursued hundreds of Chinese nationals living in the US in an effort to force their return, as part of a global campaign against the country’s diaspora, known as Operation Fox Hunt, the FBI has said.","publicationTime":1666641456.000000000,"title":"Chinese spy duo charged in Huawei case as US condemns ‘egregious’ interference","id":"world/2022/oct/24/huawei-chinese-spies-us-prosecutors-department-of-justice"},{"body":"The prosecution of a New York husband and wife arrested last week on suspicion of stealing $3.6bn in bitcoin in what has been described as “the heist of the century” may test US authorities’ ability to crack down on cybercrime. It may also test the bounds of believability as more and more colorful – and downright bizarre – details emerge of the couple at the heart of the saga which seems to lie at an unlikely nexus between the cryptocurrency, rap, self-help advice and New York eccentricity. The couple targeted in the sting, Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, a self-described “badass money maker”, were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States. They are currently on $5m and $3m bail, respectively, but held in custody after a judge in Washington granted an emergency request by the government to keep them detained. But prosecutors are not trying to tie them to the actual theft from a British Virgin Islands cryptocurrency exchange in 2016. Instead, the case unveiled by the Department of Justice on Tuesday alleges that the couple used a complicated web of transactions to transfer about 25,000 of the 119,754 bitcoin stolen by hackers. The couple’s lawyer, Samson Enzer, argued in a court filing on Wednesday there were “significant holes in the government’s case against them”. But according to Money Laundering Watch, the case may be the first time the government has brought a case not on the basis of an alleged theft, but on the couple’s alleged efforts to conceal their identity from virtual currency financial institutions with obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to report transactions to regulators. At the time of the heist, the coins were valued at $71m but are now worth about $4.5bn – according to various virtual currency exchangers. According to the government’s Statement of Facts, the stolen bitcoin was “layered” and “chain-hopped” through a series of virtual wallets to the “darknet market AlphaBay” and then back, and finally on to accounts where it was converted into fiat currency, gift cards and precious metals and withdrawn as cash from bitcoin ATMs. What may be more fascinating is that the couple at the center of what US prosecutors have described as the largest financial seizure in the history of the Department of Justice were able to utilize so little of the stolen cryptocurrency. Authorities said more than 80% of the stolen currency remained untouched in accounts associated with the couple and money-laundering allegations against them identify only small sums, including the purchase of a $500 Walmart gift card and gift cards for Uber, Hotels.com and PlayStation. Indeed the entire lifestyle of the pair hardly matches what one might imagine criminals whose alleged theft has such an astonishingly high value. Their Manhattan apartment was rented and cluttered with cat toys and exercise equipment. They walked their Bengal cat named Clarissa on a leash. The pair had a huge social media and internet presence with many hours of video and other postings. In one, unearthed by Vice, Lichtenstein apparently was filmed eating cat food. Morgan presented herself variously as “the Crocodile of Wall Street”, “Razzlekhan”, a surrealist artist and rapper with “more pizzazz than Genghis Khan”, as well as the “Turkish Martha Stewart” and the “Waffle Queen of Korea”. She wrote on her website that she was always pushing the limits. “Whether that leads to something wonderful or terrible is unclear; the only thing that’s certain is it won’t be boring or mediocre,” she said. In that respect she was not wrong. In a column for Forbes magazine that reeks with cheeky hindsight she wrote about “Experts Share Tips To Protect Your Business From Cybercriminals” accompanied by an author biography that puffed “when she’s not reverse-engineering black markets to think of better ways to combat fraud and cyber crime, she enjoys rapping and designing streetwear fashion”. She posted singles and videos on YouTube, including a 2019 song, Versace Bedouin – described as an “anthem for misfits and weirdos” – while dressed in a gold lamé jacket in front of a statue of George Washington in New York’s financial district. She gave a talk at the Williamsburg hotel in Brooklyn titled “How to Social Engineer Your Way Into Anything”. Her husband disclosed in a Facebook post that he was planned his marriage proposal around “a weird, creative multi-channel marketing campaign” that featured posters and digital ads that “captured the essence of Razzlekhan: surreal, mysterious, creepy and sexy”. But their downfall may have come because bitcoin is more easily traced on blockchain – a financial ledger – than other cryptocurrencies and because they simply had too much of it. “It [would be] mindbogglingly stupid to steal this much bitcoin,” Frank Weert, the co-founder of Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking and analytics company, told the Financial Times. “If they had stolen 500 bitcoin, no one would have bothered trying to find them, but this was the heist of the century.”","publicationTime":1644822011.000000000,"title":"‘Heist of the century’: US bitcoin case tests ability to crack down on cybercrime","id":"law/2022/feb/14/us-bitcoin-case-cybercrime"},{"body":"To its evangelists, bitcoin is a frictionless, empowering form of money that liberates citizens of the world from the shackles of banks and national governments. To sceptics, the cryptocurrency is a tool of kleptocrats and gangsters, environmentally monstrous in its consumption of energy, a digitally glamorised Ponzi scheme whose eventual crash will most hurt those least able to afford a loss. Confidence may or may not have been enhanced by the unveiling, by President Nayib Bukele, of images of a proposed bitcoin-shaped Bitcoin City in El Salvador, funded with a bitcoin bond, the currency’s logo embedded in the central plaza, a metropolis powered with geothermal energy from a nearby volcano. Bukele, the self-styled “coolest dictator in the world”, a former publicist who wears baseball caps back to front, has already made El Salvador the first country to adopt bitcoin as the official currency. “The plan is simple,” he said. “As the world falls into tyranny, we’ll create a haven for freedom.” Leaving aside the worrisome Pompeii vibe of the city’s location, some shine has come off the president’s vision with the news that the country’s investments in cryptocurrency have lost 45% of their value, that it scores CCC with the credit rating agency Fitch, and that the perceived risk of its bonds is up there with that of war-torn Ukraine. And Bukele’s talk of freedom doesn’t sit well with Amnesty International’s claim that his recent state of emergency has created “a perfect storm of human rights violations”. But why worry about any of this when you have shiny computer-generated images of a fantasy city to distract you? Unsecured credit line The use of constructional bluster by populist leaders – Trump’s wall, for example – is not in itself anything new. See also the island airport, garden bridge, Irish Sea bridge, 40 new hospitals and 300,000 homes a year promised but not delivered by Boris Johnson, and the nuclear power stations he has implausibly pledged to build at a rate of one a year. Last week his fondness for Potemkin infrastructure took a new twist. Rather than over-promise illusory schemes and under-deliver them, he decided to take credit for something actually built, the £19bn Elizabeth line in London, formerly known as Crossrail, whose central section opens to the public on Tuesday. “We get the big things done,” he boasted to the House of Commons, choosing to ignore the fact that the line was initiated under a Labour prime minister and a Labour mayor of London. He almost makes Nayib Bukele look credible. Behind the red wall If you want a light-hearted night out – a date, a birthday treat – then The House of Shades, a new play by Beth Steel, might not, unless you are an unusual person, be for you. It is a cross between Greek tragedy and what was once called kitchen sink drama, a story of ever-mounting misery set in a Nottinghamshire town from 1965 to 2019. It covers the collapse of manufacturing, the rise of Thatcherism, the promises of New Labour and the disillusionment that led to “red wall” seats voting Conservative in 2019. It features illegal abortion, graphically portrayed, and the effects of inflation, both newly significant. All presented at the Almeida theatre in the famously metropolitan London borough of Islington, not far from the former restaurant where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did the 1994 deal that shaped some of the events in the play. There’s irony here to make this audience squirm. Which, along with several other not-comfortable emotions, is probably the desired effect. • Rowan Moore is the Observer’s architecture correspondent","publicationTime":1653141621.000000000,"title":"Crypto is starting to lose its cool – just look at El Salvador | Rowan Moore","id":"commentisfree/2022/may/21/bitcoin-losing-its-cool-look-at-el-salvador"},{"body":"• We reported that Jason Penrose, who is awaiting sentencing for stalking Claire Foy, entered the UK illegally and faced the possibility of being deported, but omitted to say that he is originally from the US (The Crown star left ‘terrified in her own home’ by stalker, court hears, 29 November, p13). • A photo published with an article about an MRI scan (Pure bliss: my half-hour in an MRI scanner, 24 November, G2, p3) showed someone having a CT scan. • Other recently amended articles include: The heroic people of Iran are teaching the west a song too many of us have forgotten What does this year’s double Booker win mean for south Asian literature?

Trading in digital assets such as bitcoin and ethereum runs 24/7, unlike their conventional peers in equities on the New York and London stock exchanges, which at least get the weekend off. So one torrid week tends to run into another for this most cutting-edge of markets. Bitcoin – the cryptocurrency cornerstone – fell below the key level of $20,000 on Saturday morning, meaning it has dropped 34% in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko, which showed that ethereum, the other pillar of the market, had fallen 40% to $994 in the same period. There are fears bitcoin’s fall will trigger more sell-offs, leading to another tumultuous seven days for digital assets. The entire crypto market fell below $1 trillion last week, a precipitous decline from its peak of $3tn in November last year. A number of factors drove the declines – a mix of crypto-specific events and wider macroeconomic issues – and some of them will continue to hang over the market this week as well. On Monday the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network halted withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions”, prompting a sell-off. Celsius, a bank-like business that offers customers high interest rates on their cryptocurrency deposits, has yet to lift restrictions on withdrawals or announce a resolution of its problems. Three Arrows Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund that makes highly leveraged bets on crypto assets, is also thrashing out its future after being hit hard by the digital assets sell-off. Amid rumours of insolvency, last Wednesday, Zhu Su, the Dubai-based investor behind Three Arrows, tweeted that “we are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out”. Kyle Davies, Three Arrows’ co-founder, provided some more clarity to the Wall Street Journal on Friday, saying that the firm was exploring options including asset sales and a rescue by another firm. “We have always been believers in crypto and we still are,” Davies said. But for others there is less belief that problems will go away in the short term. Faith in cryptocurrencies was undermined last month by the collapse of terra, a so-called stablecoin, whose value was supposed to be pegged to the dollar. “I’d say that the dust has not settled yet,” says Teunis Brosens, head economist for digital finance at Dutch bank ING. “Investors may continue to act on their doubts and test the stability of various stablecoins, platforms and crypto companies. We might see more casualties in the form of liquidity in certain coins drying up, stablecoins losing their peg, and funds having to halt redemptions.” Brosens adds that some of the issues affecting the equity and bond markets have had an impact on bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was seen as a hedge, or protection, against inflation. That has not been the case recently as rising inflation has prompted central banks to raise interest rates, a combination that always hits risky assets. “Bitcoin is in fact today not seen as an inflation-proof store of value,” Brosens says. “Instead, bitcoin and crypto as a whole have so far this year behaved very much like traditional risky assets, retreating as inflation and rate-hike fears increase.” Some market watchers believe crypto will not decouple from the wider markets entirely. “What we have tended to see with crypto, and particularly bitcoin, is that it moves with the stock market,” says Kim Grauer at Chainalysis, a blockchain research firm. “There are periods that we have seen in the past few weeks where inflation figures hit, the Fed increases rates, the market tanks and bitcoin follows. But it really quickly bounces back and recorrelates with the stock market.”","publicationTime":1655593505.000000000,"title":"Crypto panic as digital assets follow share prices in a downward spiral","id":"technology/2022/jun/19/crypto-panic-as-digital-assets-follow-share-prices-in-a-downward-spiral"},{"body":"Piers Morgan’s Twitter account has been wiped of much of its content, amid reports it was hacked. The former Good Morning Britain (GMB) presenter, 57, who has 8.3 million followers on the social media site, had no profile picture, banner image or posts on Tuesday afternoon. Some tweets containing still and video images remained, as did records of tweets his account had liked. According to reports, his account shared posts overnight containing false information, racial slurs and abusive messages directed at the late Queen Elizabeth II and the singer Ed Sheeran. It comes after the account of the UK education secretary, Gillian Keegan, appeared to be hacked on Christmas Day. Her account replied to several tweets with links to websites advertising cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The tweets on Keegan’s account began appearing shortly before 7.30pm on Christmas Day, and were sent throughout the evening into the early hours on Boxing Day. Last month the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to ramp up security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, as well as update software and delete old messages. The warning came after Liz Truss’s phone was reportedly hacked by Russians in the summer when she was foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership race. Morgan’s Instagram account appeared to be operating normally. The presenter, who recently joined TalkTV as the host of its Uncensored show after quitting GMB, has not publicly addressed the apparent hack. Earlier this month, the Metropolitan police said no further action would be taken against a man suspected of sending death threats to Morgan and his family online. On Twitter, Morgan complained there was a “big problem with how big tech operates its safety procedures”. A spokesperson for TalkTV declined to comment. Neither Morgan nor Twitter have responded to requests for comment.","publicationTime":1672162519.000000000,"title":"Piers Morgan’s Twitter account abuses queen and Ed Sheeran in apparent hack","id":"media/2022/dec/27/piers-morgan-twitter-account-hacked-say-reports"},{"body":"The bitcoin price has reached a new record high, breaking through $68,000 (£50,000), and analysts predict that the world’s best-known cryptocurrency will rise further in the coming weeks. This beats the previous record high set in late October, when bitcoin reached nearly $67,700 before falling back again when investors discovered a new cryptocurrency, shiba inu. Other cryptocurrencies have also risen to record highs, such as ethereum, which soared to $4,837. Bitcoin has always been volatile but remains the world’s largest digital currency, with a market value of more than $1.1tn. Five years ago, a single bitcoin was worth about $700. Investors are buying it because they are worried about rising inflation – as an alternative to gold, a traditional inflation hedge – and as bond yields are falling. Wilfred Daye, the head of the trading platform Securitize Capital, said: “Inflation is a major consideration for investors today, and the younger generation of investors often favours cryptocurrency as a hedge over gold. In fact, while gold has slid throughout the year, bitcoin and ethereum have more than doubled. Retail investors have played a major role in fuelling this shift and institutional investors are increasingly following suit.” Another reason behind the surge in ethereum is its recent system upgrade, he said. In January, the US investment bank JPMorgan made a bold prediction, forecasting that bitcoin could rally as high as $146,000 in the long run as it competes with gold as an alternative currency. The latest gains come after the US tech entrepreneur Jack Dorsey, the chief executive and co-founder of the payment service Square, said he was committed to making bitcoin “the native currency of the internet” and his company had no plans to expand its offerings to other cryptocurrencies. He told analysts on an earnings call last week the firm was working on a number of initiatives, such as hardware wallets to store bitcoin, and functions to allow consumers to mine for the cryptocurrency. However, the Bank of England deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said last month that digital currencies such as bitcoin could trigger a financial meltdown unless governments stepped forward with tough regulations.","publicationTime":1636446146.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin price surges to record high of more than $68,000","id":"technology/2021/nov/09/bitcoin-price-record-high-cryptocurrencies-ethereum"},{"body":"The share price of cryptocurrency-focused US bank Silvergate plummeted by nearly 50% in early trading on Thursday after fresh revelations about the extent of its exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX raised questions about its ability to survive. On Wednesday, it delayed publication of its annual report and announced a fresh sale of assets to repay debts, while warning that it was assessing “its ability to continue as a going concern” in a filing with the SEC, the US financial markets regulator. Silvergate also hinted at further regulatory scrutiny ahead in the filing, which it said could hit its profitability. It said its business could be adversely affected by “various litigation (including private litigation) and regulatory and other inquiries and investigations”, including by banking regulators, congressional committees and the US Department of Justice. That warning caused a flurry of activity, with major partners including crypto exchange Coinbase dropping Silvergate in a rush to safety. Coinbase, which used Silvergate to handle cash transactions for customers, said that in “light of recent developments and out of an abundance of caution, Coinbase is no longer accepting or initiating payments to or from Silvergate”. “Coinbase has de minimis corporate exposure to Silvergate,” the company added in a tweet. Silvergate’s shares tumbled by nearly 50% to $7 in early trading on the New York stock exchange on Thursday after Coinbase’s announcement, before recovering slightly to $7.60. They had closed at $13.53 the previous day. At the peak of the crypto boom in late 2021, its stock price had hit an all-time high of $219.75. The bank, which is more than 30 years old, shifted its entire business behind serving the cryptocurrency industry in 2013, and grew rapidly alongside the sector. But the collapse of FTX left it exposed, and at the beginning of 2023 it announced plans to sell $5bn worth of assets for cash, booking a loss of almost 20% in the process, in order to deal with “sustained lower deposit levels and to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet”. As cryptocurrency users had withdrawn funds from crypto exchanges, those exchanges had in turn withdrawn currency from their accounts at Silvergate, leaving it dangerously illiquid. It attributed those withdrawals to a “crisis of confidence across the ecosystem”. But even as Silvergate struggles, other parts of the crypto sector are thriving. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both up about 40% from the start of the year, and even after a stumble caused by its relationship to the bank, Coinbase itself is up 76% year to date. But, according to industry newsletter Crypto Global, the rally isn’t leading to a burst of optimism. “Crypto founders and investors, for once, are actually embracing a measured mentality,” said writer Akash Pasricha.","publicationTime":1677777012.000000000,"title":"Near 50% fall in Silvergate’s shares over FTX exposure prompts survival doubts","id":"technology/2023/mar/02/near-50-per-cent-fall-in-silvergate-shares-over-ftx-exposure-prompts-survival-doubts"},{"body":"Crypto exchanges must report suspected sanctions breaches to UK authorities under new rules brought in amid concerns that bitcoin and other cryptoassets are being used to dodge restrictions imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Official guidance was updated on 30 August to explicitly include “cryptoassets” among those that must be frozen if sanctions are imposed on a person or company. As well as digital currencies, such as bitcoin, ether and tether, cryptoassets could include other notionally valuable digital assets such as non-fungible tokens. The rules, set by the Treasury’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, will mean crypto exchanges are committing a criminal offence if they fail to report clients designated for sanctions. Under the rules, crypto exchanges must immediately act if they suspect that one of their customers is under sanctions, or if they suspect a breach of sanctions – giving them similar obligations to professionals such as estate agents, accountants, lawyers and jewellers. Financial sanctions on people and companies linked to the regime of Vladimir Putin have been among the UK’s most prominent responses to the invasion of Ukraine. Targets for sanctions have included oligarchs and relatives with direct interests in cryptoassets. These have included Vladimir Potanin, the “nickel king” who was previously Russia’s second richest man, who backed Atomyze, a Swiss blockchain business. Said Gutseriev, son of the oligarch Mikhail, owned a stake in a Belarus-based cryptocurrency exchange until August 2021, before he was hit with sanctions on the same day as Potanin in June. The metals billionaire Oleg Deripaska has previously urged Russia’s central bank to allow bitcoin to be used as a means of payment. There is no suggestion that they have used cryptoassets to evade sanctions. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, in April said it had blocked the accounts of relatives of Russian politicians, including Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Elizaveta Peskova, the daughter of Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. The exchange had previously dismissed fears of crypto being used for sanctions evasion. Using cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and move money around the world was already illegal in the UK under laws that cover all “economic resources”. However, the change underlines authorities’ concern about the relatively new assets, which could be useful for evading sanctions because users do not rely on regulated entities to make transactions. Anna Bradshaw, a partner at Peters &amp; Peters, a London law firm, said the UK’s move was “in line with the more general expansion of financial services and anti-financial crime regulation to the crypto sector”. “Crypto and virtual assets are treated no differently to any other type of assets for the purposes of an asset freeze,” she said. “Having said that, reliance on crypto or virtual currencies could potentially make it more difficult to detect that a sanctioned party is involved, or that it relates to sanctioned trade or other sanctioned activity – at least in time for steps to be taken to prevent it.” Regulators have taken note. In February, representatives from the White House and the US Treasury asked crypto exchanges to stop operating in Russia. In March, UK financial regulators issued a joint statement confirming that cryptoassets fall under sanctions rules. The EU in April also banned large crypto transactions with Russia. A Treasury spokesperson said: “It is vital to address the risk of cryptoassets being used to breach or circumvent financial sanctions. These new requirements will cover firms that either record holdings of, or enable the transfer of cryptoassets and are therefore most likely to hold relevant information.”","publicationTime":1662301125.000000000,"title":"UK forces crypto exchanges to report suspected sanction breaches","id":"technology/2022/sep/04/crypto-exchanges-suspected-sanction-breaches-russia"},{"body":"Australia’s broadcast industry group has condemned Facebook’s parent company Meta over its handling of scam ads featuring TV stars including David Koch and Karl Stefanovic, saying the company’s response time is inadequate and damages broadcaster reputations. Free TV Australia – which represents broadcasters including Seven, Nine and Ten – said in a submission published this month to a Senate inquiry into digital platforms that scam ads featuring their networks’ stars without the network or star’s knowledge or authorisation, and fake news stories had been causing harm to consumers over the past few years. The group highlighted scam ads on Facebook featuring fake endorsements from the Nine news reporter Georgie Gardner for an app, a fake account purporting to be the former Today Show host Allison Langdon encouraging people to enter a scam competition seeking bank details, and scam cryptocurrency ads featuring the Today host Karl Stefanovic and Sunrise host David Koch. “His image was used as one of many fake celebrity endorsements that baited and lured users into scam bitcoin investments,” Free TV said regarding the fake Koch ads. The group said scammers had also created fake Seven-branded Facebook pages and replied to users in the comment sections on Seven’s Facebook posts, telling them they’d won a prize. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched a case in the federal court in March last year alleging Meta had “aided and abetted” celebrity scam ads that had cost some Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars. In its own submission to the inquiry, the ACCC said the losses from scam ads on social networks had almost doubled from a reported $49m in 2020 to $92m in 2021. These figures are likely to be much higher because most victims do not report their losses to Scamwatch. The case had yet to be heard, and Free TV Australia said despite the regulator taking this step, Meta’s takedown processes remained “inadequate”. “Fake ads continue to quickly reappear after they are taken down. These inadequate takedown processes damage the business reputations of broadcasters and also the personal reputations of the celebrities and media personalities that are misrepresented,” the organisation said. “Notwithstanding the significant consumer harm from these scams, in addition to the reputational harm to Free TV members, the digital platforms are persistently slow in responding to takedown requests.” Free TV said the social media platforms should be required to ensure that the content they were publishing was not “fake, damaging, misleading or defamatory”, and called for a social media code specifically targeting scam ads. A spokesperson for Meta said scammers were a challenge across the board online, not just limited to social media platforms. “We’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of our services, and dedicate substantial resources and technology solutions to protect our community from fake accounts and other inauthentic behaviour,” the spokesperson said. In the ACCC’s fifth interim report arising from the digital platforms inquiry in November, the regulator recommended to the government that the digital platforms should appropriately verify advertisers to reduce the risk of scams, and implement a “notice-and-action” mechanism that would require the platforms to take action when a user reports a scam. The sixth interim report is due this week.","publicationTime":1679925651.000000000,"title":"Meta slammed over scam ads on Facebook featuring Australian TV personalities","id":"technology/2023/mar/28/australian-tv-networks-criticise-meta-over-inadequate-response-time-to-damaging-scam-ads"},{"body":"European stocks have closed lower for the second day in a row.

Previously strong sectors such as banking are beginning to feel the pressure as investors reassess the outlook both for global GDP and tighter monetary policy, the latter exemplified by a pushing back of expectations around the first European Central Bank rate hike. European markets continue to be the most affected, from a combination of closeness to Russia (both geographically and economically) and by the weaker earnings outlook here compared to the US. Kremlin pronouncements have become more strident today, further reducing the attractiveness of the continent’s equities. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow – JK Ministers from International Energy Agency member states are pondering the release of 60m barrels from oil reserves, to bring crude oil prices down, Reuters is reporting, citing two sources. The US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm is chairing an extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Paris-based IEA, which represents 30 nations and has coordinated three emergency oil stock releases in the past. It was founded in 1974 as an energy watchdog. Brent crude is now trading at $104.25 a barrel, a $6.25 increase on the day. Any disruption from Russia, which has so far kept oil flowing to the west and exports around 4-5m barrels a day, could send prices even higher. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The war in Ukraine will prevent US inflation from falling as much as it otherwise would have in the coming months, but it will have little impact on the real economy, so we doubt it will stop the Fed. Even after the recent escalation of Western sanctions, the direct impact of the conflict on the US economy is still likely to be negligible. Goods exports to Russia and Ukraine combined were worth just $9bn last year, and US banks have little direct exposure to either country. The conflict may drive renewed disruptions to some global supply chains but, again, the geographic distance means the US is far less exposed than continental Europe. Instead, the main impact will come via the rise in global commodity prices. The further rise in crude oil prices to $100 per barrel for WTI, up from $85 at the end of January, means headline inflation will remain worryingly elevated over next couple of months. Base effects mean that, even if prices don’t fall back, energy inflation will still fall this year, but that decline will be a bit slower than we previously anticipated. Retail gasoline prices could hit $4 per gallon soon, up from $3.40 in January, meaning that households will be spending an additional $75bn annualised on filling up at the pump. While rising food inflation may weigh further on household purchasing power, the US is a net exporter of agricultural commodities, particularly wheat, corn and soybeans. It’s also worth noting that, while European natural gas prices have surged, the US market has been unaffected. Financial market contagion is still possible, but the resilience in recent days is reassuring. We’ll be watching for any hints from Chair Jerome Powell at his congressional testimony tomorrow but, while we suspect the increased uncertainty makes a 50bp rate hike next month even less likely, we still expect the Fed to raise rates by 25bp at least four times this year. Here is our full story on the equivalent factory survey for Britain. UK manufacturers are facing a sharp rise in costs as the Russian invasion of Ukraine undermines the progress made towards fixing global supply chains before the conflict broke out, economists have warned. Output growth among American manufacturers picked up in February thanks to stronger demand and easing supply disruption, according to the latest monthly snapshot from IHS Markit. It warned that the war in Ukraine was likely to lead to further supply chain disruption, higher inflation and a reversal in business optimism. Although input costs increased at the slowest pace for nine months last month, selling prices ticked higher at the sharpest rate since last November. The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 57.3 in February, from 55.5 in January and only slightly lower than the ‘flash’ estimate of 57.5. The headline figure was below the peaks seen in 2021, but signalled a stronger upturn in the health of the manufacturing sector, with sharper output and new order expansions contributing to overall growth. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: With the survey data collected prior to the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, the full impact of the situation is yet to appear in the data. Supply chains are likely to be further disrupted, with existing shortages exacerbated by safety stock building, and prices will likely come under further upward pressure. Perhaps most important will be the effect on business optimism and whether the improvement in prospects seen in February will be reversed, which could lead to reduced spending and investment. Wall Street has slipped at the open, as banking stocks declined further, while surging oil prices boosted energy stocks. The Dow jones industrial average fell 80 points to 33,813, a 0.2% drop, while the S&amp;P 500 opened almost 11 points lower at 4,363 and the Nasdaq dropped 34 points, or 0.25%, to 13,716. While Asian shares moved cautiously higher, European shares are firmly in the red again. The UK’s FTSE 100 has lost 50 points, or 0.66%, to 7,408 while stock markets in Germany, France and Italy have all slid by more than 2%. Oil, gas and other commodity prices continue to climb. Brent crude has jumped $6 to $103.93 a barrel after touching a seven-year high of close to $106 last Thursday, while US light crude is up $5.65% at $101.28 a barrel. Both are about 6% higher on the day. The benchmark British natural gas contract has advanced 14.5% to 272.30p per therm and the Dutch contract has advanced 17% to €115.62 per megawatt hour. Wheat prices have hit a fresh 13-year high and corn prices have also gained 5% in Chicago, amid fears over supply from Russia and Ukraine, major exporters of wheat and corn. In Moscow, the rouble is sliding again, trading 5.3% lower at 99.6 per dollar. The latest western sanctions drove the Russian currency to a fresh record low of 120 per dollar yesterday. Against the euro, it has lost 3.7% to 109.9. The Moscow stock exchange remains closed for a second day and the Central Bank of Russia said it would announce before 9am Moscow time tomorrow whether it will reopen. Here is a round-up of today’s stories: Oil and gas prices and other commodities have jumped again today. Wheat futures in Chicago rose more than 5% to hit $9.84 a bushel, the highest since April 2008. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat and together with Ukraine, accounts for about a third of the global wheat supply. Both countries are a major corn producers, and corn futures climbed nearly 5% to $7.25 per bushel, the highest since last May. This threatens to push global food prices, which were already surging before the war in Ukraine, even higher. Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is considering pulling out of Russia, and would be the first European bank to do so since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, Reuters reported, citing sources. RBI has operated in Russia through its Moscow-based subsidiary since 1996, a few years after the Soviet Union collapsed. That business is one of the biggest banks operating in Russia, the 10th biggest by assets, and contributed almost a third of the Austrian banking group’s net profit of €1.5bn last year. A decision to quit Russia (and Ukraine) is not imminent but could be triggered if RBI’s businesses in those countries need further cash or capital, one of the sources told Reuters. The other source said RBI could exit Russia and Ukraine by handing over ownership to another entity, or temporarily suspend activity. Russia’s prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has said Moscow would temporarily stop foreigners selling assets, complicating any attempts to quit the country. As many people do when discussing the complex world of cryptocurrencies, Vladimir Putin kept it simple: “Of course, we also have certain competitive advantages here, especially in the so-called mining.” After events this weekend, when Russia was hit by severe financial sanctions, the Russian president might be considering capitalising on those advantages, writes our global technology editor Dan Milmo. Putin was speaking in January, days after the country’s central bank proposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining. In the case of bitcoin, the cornerstone cryptocurrency, mining is the energy-intensive process by which computers verify new bitcoin transactions – putting them on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain – and generate new bitcoins as a reward for that work. The Bank of Russia was emphatic in its warning, saying that cryptocurrency mining entailed “significant risks for the economy and financial stability.”. One week later, Putin appeared to be less sure, pointing that Russia had advantages in cryptocurrency mining due to its huge energy wealth and expertise in the field. A second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine has been scheduled for tomorrow, the Russian state news agency Tass has cited a source on the Russian side as saying. The first round of talks that took place near the Belarus-Ukraine border on Monday ended after about six hours with no breakthrough, but both sides agreed to a follow-up round in the coming days. More on our Ukraine crisis live blog here. German headline inflation has gone up, instead of further retreating in February, and analysts at ING say the economic implications of the war in Ukraine are likely to bring back an economic nightmare from the past: stagflation. According to a first estimate based on the regional inflation data, German headline inflation rose to an annual rate of 5.1% from 4.9% in January. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said: With the war in Ukraine and continued upward pressure on energy prices, the direction for German inflation has changed: it is no longer down, but up. Looking ahead, with the war in Ukraine and continued tension and upward pressure on energy prices, headline inflation in Germany will accelerate rather than slow down in the coming months. The pass-through to all kinds of sectors is in full swing. Add to this additional price mark-ups in the hospitality, culture and leisure sectors once the current round of [Covid-19] restrictions is over and it is hard to see inflation coming down significantly any time soon. Against the backdrop of recent geopolitical events, we now expect German inflation to average around 4.5% this year and to stay above 3% even at year-end. The UK asset manager abrdn has described Russia and Belarus as “non-investable” on ethical grounds. Steve Bird, the chief executive of the firm, which has £542bn assets under management, told Reuters that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “absolutely shocking,” adding: We already had [Russia, Belarus] on a low rating. After the conflict we deemed them non-investable. We have acted to reduce our holdings in Russia and Belarus. We will not invest in Russia and Belarus in the foresseeable future. The fund manager, a major player in emerging markets, has around £2bn of client money invested in Russia and Belarus, amounting to less than 0.5% of its assets under management. The Russian investments are spread across 200 funds. Other asset managers, including JPMorgan and Pictet, have suspended trading in Russia-focused funds this week. The hedge fund Man Group said today that its exposure to Russia and Ukraine was “negligible” and that it had cut its investments there in recent weeks. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told the European parliament “nobody is going to break us” or “intervene with our freedom,” in the face of the Russian onslaught. Satellite images show a huge Russian convoy north-west of Kyiv. You can follow the latest developments on our Ukraine crisis live blog here: Jaguar Land Rover has temporarily stopped selling its luxury cars to Russia, a decision welcomed by the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, owned by India’s Tata Motors, sold 6,900 cars to Russia last year. It cited “trading challenges” for its decision. It looks like sanctions imposed on Russia by western nations are making it difficult for the carmaker to deliver its vehicles to Russia. Separately, the container shipping companies Maersk and MSC have announced today that they are halting shipping to and from Russia. A JLR spokesperson said in a statement (reported by the BBC) its priority was “the wellbeing of our entire workforce and their families, as well as those within our extended network”. The current global context also presents us with trading challenges, so we are pausing the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market and continually monitoring the situation on behalf of our global customer base. The UK ban on any vessel connected with Russia from entering British ports will come into effect this afternoon – and includes private yachts, according to Boris Johnson’s spokesman. The legislation will take effect this afternoon. The legislation will apply to Russian-flagged, owned, registered, controlled, chartered or operated vessels, and would include private yachts. In other inflation news, UK grocery prices climbed at their fastest rate in over eight years in February, according to data from market analysts Kantar, who warned the squeeze on shoppers will continue as a result of supply chain disruption and the conflict in Ukraine, writes my colleague Joanna Partridge. Food price inflation reached 4.3% last month, the highest level seen since September 2013, as the price of items including savoury snacks, fresh beef and cat food rose the fastest. However the cost of some products, including bacon, beer, and spirits has been falling. Britain’s households are already facing a cost of living crisis, after the UK’s annual inflation rate hit 5.5% in January, hitting its highest level in almost 30 years. However, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, economists had predicted that there was more pain to come in April, when household energy bills will soar. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, predicted that food prices are likely to continue their climb: Apart from the start of the pandemic, when we saw grocers cut promotional deals to maintain availability, this is the fastest rate of inflation we’ve recorded since September 2013. Added to this, ongoing supply chain pressures and the potential impact of the conflict in Ukraine are set to continue pushing up prices paid by consumers. After Maersk halted shipping to and from Russia this morning, the Geneva-headquartered shipping company MSC has also stopped cargo bookings to and from Russia, apart from food, medical equipment and humanitarian goods. The world’s number one container line said it was implementing with immediate effect “a temporary stoppage on all cargo bookings to/from Russia, covering all access areas including Baltics, Black Sea and Far East Russia”. Inflation in Italy accelerated to an annual rate of 5.7% in February from 4.8% in January, according to preliminary estimates from Italy’s statistics office Istat. Energy costs surged nearly 46%, compared with 38.6% in January. However, even stripping out energy and unprocessed food (both volatile), core inflation rose to 1.7% from 1.5%, while inflation excluding energy picked up to 2.1% from 1.8%. The war in Ukraine, which has sent wholesale gas and oil prices surging, threatens to push inflation even higher. Alberto Lopez Valenzuela, founder and chief executive of the analysts alva, said business must move quickly to disentangle from Russia – or face reputational consequences. As reported earlier today, the French oil and gas group TotalEnergies has refused to follow in the footsteps of BP and Shell in severing its Russian ties. It is clinging on to its 19.4% stake in Novatek, Russia’s largest independent natural gas producer, whose other shareholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Putin ally, who also sits on Novatek’s board. Tui, the world’s largest tour operator, has also refused to take action against it single largest shareholder, Alexey Mordashov, who is a pro-Putin oligarch and owns a third of the travel company. Valenzuela said: BP’s move to offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft on Sunday was followed on Monday by Shell announcing that it would exit its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom. Norwegian oil group Equinor and Germany’s Daimler Truck are both ending their partnerships with Russian businesses. Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover said they are halting deliveries of cars to the country as the corporate fallout from the appalling invasion of Ukraine spreads. Sport, too, is scrambling to distance itself from Vladimir Putin. Last night, Fifa and Uefa suspended all Russian football clubs and national teams “until further notice”. This announcement came after Fifa was accused of not going far enough by allowing Russia to continue playing as ‘RFU’ combined with a ban on its flag and anthem. What next? Well, we can be sure of one thing – much more is to come. As the world’s governments turn their backs on Russia as international pariahs, so business must follow suit. Vladimir Putin’s miscalculation over his invasion of Ukraine could herald big changes in global finance, writes Jim O’Neill, a British economist and a former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. During [recent] years, I got to know several senior technocrats in the policy world, primarily from the central bank and finance ministry, and leading economic influencers, and I was often struck by how widely the belief was about Putin’s excellence as a strategist. I had for some years been expecting some great era of big reforms to be unleashed due to these views but alas, they never came, and instead, this game of playing on his perception of western weakness dominated his apparent strategic thinking. Well, after the weekend just passed, and the western financial sanctions announced, it seems to me that Putin isn’t such a great strategist after all. I don’t know where the idea of freezing the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves originated, but whoever thought of it has come up with a cracker, alongside the bold move by leading western nations to agree to remove key Russian banks from the Swift plumbing network of the financial system. You can read his analysis here: European shares are firmly in the red again, with the FTSE 100 index in London down almost 1%, while the German, French and Italian indices dropped more than 2%. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has expressed confidence that the global sanctions on Russia would lead to the collapse of its economy. He told France Info radio: We will provoke the collapse of the Russian economy. We are waging total economic and financial war against Russia, Putin, and his government, and let’s be clear, the Russian people will also pay the consequences. The Anglo-Russian gold miner Polymetal has tumbled a further 27% this morning while the Russian steelmaker Evraz, which is 29% owned by the Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich, has retreated nearly 12% after earlier gains. After heavy losses in recent days, both are set to lose their FTSE 100 status in the first FTSE 100 reshuffle of the year tomorrow. The changes will be announced after the market closes on Wednesday and be based on today’s closing prices. They will take effect on Monday 21 March. In the first FTSE 100 reshuffle of this year tomorrow, Evraz and Polymetal will lose their FTSE 100 status. Royal Mail could also be relegated, while Howden Joinery and the gold producer Endeavour Mining could be promoted to the blue-chip index. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, said: The first FTSE100 reshuffle of 2022 is due shortly and is likely to be reflective of the current market turmoil resulting from geopolitical tensions. The precipitous falls in the share prices of miners with Russian exposure has guaranteed that both Evraz and Polymetal will lose their FTSE 100 status. Share price declines in the year to date of 76% and 79% have left both companies languishing well below the 110th spot which would be required in order to remain. In terms of their replacements, kitchen supplier Howden Joinery is poised to be promoted despite the share price having declined by 7.3% in the year to date. Recent pre-tax profits were comfortably ahead of consensus, with an improvement in margins which lifted the shares on the day of the announcement. Gold producer Endeavour Mining is also likely to move up to the premier index, despite being outside the usual criterion of finishing 90th or above in terms of market capitalisation. The shares have risen by almost 25% in the year to date, boosted by a move towards haven investments following on from the escalating situation between Russia and the Ukraine, with the gold price having spiked by around 5% so far this year. He said Royal Mail’s 22% share price decline so far this year may send the shares tumbling out of the index once more. The company regained its place in the FTSE 100 last June, having previously been relegated in December 2018. Should Royal Mail find itself ousted from the FTSE100, there is barely a glimmer of light between the two companies in line to replace it, namely either Centrica or easyJet. Having risen so far this year by 9% and 8% respectively, Centrica is currently shading it, having been boosted by a recent return to a healthy profit having dealt with a sizeable pension deficit and the possibility of a return to dividend payments emerging into view. Meanwhile, a promotion for easyJet would be the latest in a rollercoaster ride, which has seen the shares relegated from the FTSE-100 in June 2019, promoted again in December 2019, only to be relegated once more (along with Centrica) in June 2020, having suffered the effects of the height of the pandemic. Some companies have moved to sever their ties with Russia, such as the UK oil groups BP and Shell, which have decided to ditch their alliances with Russian state-backed energy firms Rosneft and Gazprom respectively. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund said on Sunday that it would sell its Russian investments, and the UK’s biggest private pension fund followed suit today. Meanwhile, France’s TotalEnergies condemned Moscow’s military aggression in Ukraine and said it would not fund new projects in Russia. However, it held on to its 19.4% stake in Novatek, Russia’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas. TotalEnergies supports the scope and strength of the sanctions put in place by Europe and will implement them regardless of the consequences (currently being assessed) on its activities in Russia. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said earlier today that he would be holding talks with the heads of TotalEnergies and the energy firm Engie about their business interests in Russia. He told France Info radio: I believe there is a question of principle in working with any political or financial person close to Russian power. The Danish shipping giant A.P. Møller – Mærsk will temporarily halt all container shipping to and from Russia, deepening the country’s isolation following its invasion of Ukraine last Thursday. Western sanctions have closed Europe’s airspace to Russian aircraft, shut out some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system, and restricted Moscow’s ability to use its $630bn in foreign reserves. Maersk said it was “deeply concerned by how the crisis keeps escalating in Ukraine”. We closely follow the ever-evolving situation with government posing new sanctions on Russia and we start seeing the effect on global supply chain flows... such as delays, detention of cargo by customs authorities across various transshipment hubs, unpredictable operational impacts. As the stability and safety of our operations is already being directly and indirectly impacted by sanctions, new Maersk bookings to and from Russia will be temporarily suspended, with exception of foodstuffs, medical and humanitarian supplies. This exception is to underline that our company is focusing on the social responsibility and take the efforts to support the society despite all the complications and uncertainties within current supply chain to/from Russia. The Bank of England said mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to 74,000 in January, above the 12-month pre-pandemic average up to February 2020 of 66,700. Britons borrowed £5.9bn in mortgage debt, up from £4bn in December and above the pre-pandemic average of £4.3bn. The figures suggest the UK housing market remained buoyant at the start of the year, and experts said many people are trying to move house before interest rates go up further. Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: Purchasing activity in the mortgage market remained above seasonal norms during January, despite Omicron clouding the economic outlook stock levels wallowing close to all-time lows relative to demand. We expect the data to show another pick up in the coming months. Many potential purchasers opted to wait during the pandemic, whether due to low stock or the uncertain outlook. We’re now seeing large numbers seeking to move before rates rise further. The limiting factor on purchasing activity during the weeks ahead will be the shortage of properties to purchase. The Bank of England’s remortgaging data doesn’t capture deals when borrowers stick with their current lender, but we are seeing significant numbers of borrowers looking to remortgage ahead of another potential rate rise in March. There is little doubt that mortgage rates will continue to rise over the course of the year, what’s unclear is how fast. The outlook is much more uncertain amid the escalating conflict in Ukraine. Crude oil prices continue to climb, and Brent crude is back above $100 a barrel. It touched $105.79 last Thursday, the highest since August 2014, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the moment, the global benchmark is $3.50 higher at $101.44, a 3.5% gain. US light crude has added 3% to $98.51 a barrel. Natural gas prices are also up again, but at a more modest rate. The British benchmark has gained 5.5% to 250.96p per therm, while the Dutch contract is 7.5% higher at €106 per megawatt hour. The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said yesterday that Russian vessels will be banned from British ports, in an effort to ensure the Kremlin is not funding its war effort in Ukraine with sales of oil and gas in the UK. Britain’s manufacturers ramped up production growth to a seven-month high in February, aided by stronger domestic demand, fewer raw material shortages and easing global supply chain pressures. Although input price inflation remained elevated, the latest survey from IHS Markit and CIPS (Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply) also signalled that cost increases were starting to ease. The seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI [purchasing managers’ index] rose to a three-month high of 58.0 in February, up from 57.3 in January. The PMI has remained above the neutral 50.0 mark for 21 successive months. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: There were certainly several positives for the UK’s manufacturing sector in February as 64% of manufacturing businesses remained optimistic. However, this success comes with a health warning as the Ukrainian crisis deepens and the potential for higher commodity prices, disruptions to supply and economic pain must be considered by businesses as they try to build resilience into their supply chains in the coming months. Manufacturing output growth in the eurozone was supported by stronger demand and fewer delivery delays in February, according to monthly snapshot from IHS Markit. It warned of new inflation risks from the war in Ukraine, which has driven oil and gas prices higher. Its final reading for the manufacturing PMI for February shows: Final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 58.2 in February (Flash: 58.4, Jan Final: 58.7) Demand for eurozone goods rises at fastest rate since last August Supplier delivery times lengthen to weakest extent for over a year but inflation remains steep The survey shows that growth in both output and new orders among eurozone manufacturers gained further momentum last month following improvements in January. There were also fewer supplier delivery delays across the month. However, capacities across the sector continued to be tested and, while rates of both input cost and output price inflation slowed in February, they were still among the fastest on record. Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit said: Don’t let the drop in the headline PMI distract from what should be viewed as a largely positive month for the euro area manufacturing sector in February. Demand for goods is trending higher, with the rate of expansion accelerating to a six-month high. Underlying sales conditions are clearly strengthening as Europe overcomes the Omicron wave of Covid-19 and businesses step up their recovery efforts. Now, the Russia-Ukraine situation, which also carries the risk of dampening growth, adds fresh fuel to inflation risks, and we’ve seen Brent crude already moving higher in response. It’s going to take prudent macroeconomic policy management to re-anchor inflation expectations without denting the demand recovery too heavily. There is an eerily calm mood in markets. European stocks are falling again, but not collapsing... The UK’s FTSE 100 index has followed the rest of Europe and is now trading 11 points lower at 7,447 (a 0.15% drop), giving up earlier modest gains. Germany’s Dax has lost 1% while France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MiB are 0.7% and 0.9% lower respectively. The rouble sell-off has also eased while Russian stock markets remain closed. Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at the investment firm Markets.com, said: Russia exposed stocks more mixed this morning: Polymetal, JPMorgan Russian Securities and Petropavlosk all lower again, whilst Evraz and Ferrexpo rallied a bit. The rouble has come off its lows and trades around 91 to the US dollar. At the moment it looks as though the Russian central bank is doing a not terrible job of supporting the currency, but through some pretty tough measures – massive rate hike and capital controls. How long can this last? First Switzerland and now even Monaco is kicking out Russian money! As for Russia and Ukraine....the dreadful situation gets worse as heavy shelling of built-up areas shows us what is to come. Talks yesterday didn’t get far but the two sides have agreed to try again as a massive Russian convoy starts to encircle Kyiv. Bombing of civilians will harden Western public opinion against Russia – voters are already taking a pretty hard line across Europe. Unified public opinion complicates matters for governments who might prefer to base policy solely on the advice of their military intelligence and strategic advisors. But that is the way of things. For markets, this means the question of direct sanctions on oil and gas exports from Russia is a matter of when not if. Canada has already unilaterally banned Russian oil imports, though these are microscopic compared to Europe’s appetite for Russia’s crude and natural gas. The chief executive of the UK’s biggest private pension scheme is seeking to offload its £450m of assets linked to Russia, saying there is a moral as well as financial imperative for companies to do so after the invasion of Ukraine, reports my colleague Mark Sweney. Simon Pilcher, the head of the Universities Superannuation Scheme, said that it has sold off about half of the portfolio of investments it has connected to Russia in the last few weeks. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, Pilcher said: We think there is a clear financial as well as a moral case for divestment with respect to our Russian holdings. Morals drive finance and if you are a financial investor and you don’t think about the moral impacts of what you are doing you are both shortsighted and, dare I say it, immoral. Norways’ sovereign wealth fund, the biggest in the world, announced on Sunday that it would sell all its Russian assets. While the rouble has steadied in Moscow, Russian stock and derivative markets will remain closed today for a second day. The Central Bank of Russia decided not to reopen stock markets yesterday after heavy western sanctions on the country. London-listed Russian shares plunged yesterday, including Sberbank and the oil and gas producers Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil. This morning, Sberbank bounced back 20% and Gazprom rose nearly 12%, while Rosneft added 2.8% and Lukoil fell a further 19%. The Russian steelmaking and mining group Evraz is the top riser on the FTSE 100 index, up nearly 5%, after heavy losses yesterday. European stocks are mixed after the opening bell. UK’s FTSE 100 index up 25 points, or 0.3%, at 7,484 Europe’s Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.1% France’s CAC down 0.2% Spain’s Ibex down 0.2% Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.36% As markets opened in a panic on Monday, many Russians rushed to local cashpoints in Moscow to retrieve their savings before the damage got any worse, write our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer in Moscow. “It said they had dollars so I came here immediately,” said Alexei Presnyakov, 32, pointing to an app for Russia’s Tinkoff Bank, indicating he could withdraw hard currency. About 20 people were queued in line. “Yesterday [the rate] was 80 [to the dollar]. Today it’s 100. Or 150.” Within minutes, however, the word traveled down the queue: the dollars were gone. Disney is pausing all theatrical releases in Russia, including the upcoming Pixar film Turning Red, citing the “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis”. Our financial editor Nils Pratley has looked at BP and Shell leading the rush to exit Russia: There can be no going back. Russian vessels will be banned from British ports, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Monday, in an effort to ensure the Kremlin is not funding its war effort in Ukraine with sales of oil and gas in the UK. ‘It’s about bloody time’: UK finally moves to block Russia’s ‘dirty money,’ writes my colleague Rob Davies. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced clean-up measures to tackle London’s reputation as “Londongrad”. Oligarchs and kleptocrats will no longer be able to hide their ownership of property through companies based in overseas territories, the business secretary said on Monday, but refused to give a date for when the change would come into force, reports our deputy political editor Rowena Mason. Here’s an analysis of the sanctions imposed on Russia so far. UK business leaders have urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to postpone the “ill-timed” and “illogical” £12bn increase in national insurance contributions, amid warnings over soaring costs for companies and households as the Russian invasion of Ukraine drives up inflation. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said: The direct implication of Russian sanctions was a surge in cryptocurrency prices, and especially Bitcoin. The coin, which was moving along with the risk assets less than a couple of days ago, is now The Asset that Russians and Ukrainians rely on to get their funds out of the traditional system which has become very hostile to them. It is reported that Bitcoin purchases using Rubles and Hryvnias soared as Russia imposed sanctions on its citizens. Being able to transact value in Bitcoin also helps Russian oligarchs go around the Western sanctions. It may also help Russian companies and even the Russian central bank to move funds as these entities can no longer access US dollars, and most of the Russian banks are no longer part of the SWIFT system. If there is no policy response from the West to the Bitcoin adoption from Russia, the positive trend could further develop and make Bitcoin the number one safe haven asset in the war setup. Yet, how much the West would tolerate the Bitcoin interference to its political decisions is a major question, that increases the regulatory risks for cryptocurrencies. For Russians though, the cryptocurrency risk is definitively worth be taken. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Talks near the Belarus-Ukraine between Ukrainian and Russian officials yesterday ended inconclusively and were overshadowed by intensifying fighting in Ukraine. We’ve woken up to news that more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, after a Russian strike on a military base. As western nations imposed wider sanctions on Russia, Mastercard said last night that it had blocked several financial institutions from its payment network. The New York-based firm said it would continue to work with regulators in coming days, and pledged to contribute $2m for humanitarian relief for Ukraine. Visa made a similar donation, and said in a statement that it was taking action to ensure compliance with sanctions. Expectations are growing that Russia could turn to crypto currencies after being shut out of the Swift international payment system and with sanctions imposed on its banks. Bitcoin, the world’s best-known cryptocurrency, has reversed declines in recent days and rose 4.4% to $43,460 this morning, after a 10% gain yesterday. Asian shares were firmer after heavy selling across global stock markets in recent days. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.4% and the Australian stock market rose 0.7%. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The markets are going to focus on the broader implications of what’s gong to happen around energy prices, what that means for inflation across parts of the world. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is trading just below $100 a barrel, at $99.92, up 2%, after touching a seven-year high of $105.799 last Thursday when Russia invaded Ukraine. Gold, a traditional safe-haven investment, has eased to $1,907 an ounce. The Russian rouble has stabilised after it plunged 30% to a record low of 120 per dollar on Monday. The Russian central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% and announced a slew of other measures to stem the decline. This morning the rouble is down 0.3% to 94.85 per dollar, and is unchanged versus the euro at 106.02. After European markets closed yesterday, Shell announced it would divest its Russian assets and end its alliance with Gazprom, following a move by BP the previous day to get rid of a 20% stake in Rosneft, which will cost it $25bn. Attention has now turned to oil giants like TotalEnergies and Exxon, which haven’t yet disclosed what they will do. US firm Exxon is now under pressure to sever its ties with Rosneft, and offload a 30% stake in a Sakhalin Island oil and gas fields projecct in Russia’s Far East. France’s TotalEnergies holds a 19.4% stake in publicly listed Novatek, reputedly with close ties to the Kremlin as Putin ally Gennady Timchenko sits on its board. Novatek is Russia’s second-largest gas producer.

The project, called “the merge”, will result in ethereum switching the underlying technology it uses for validating crypto transactions to a new process that requires less energy to manage. Once complete, the merge will end the role of “miners” in the ethereum ecosystem, helping to dramatically reduce electricity usage. These users run huge quantities of powerful, purpose-built technology all day, every day, to generate random numbers that affect the security of the overall network. The energy consumption of ethereum mining is currently estimated at about 72 terawatt-hours a year, according to Alex de Vries, a Dutch economist who runs the Digiconomist website. That is comparable with the power consumption of Colombia, with a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Switzerland. The changeover will lead to the platform moving away from a “proof of work” process, which requires cryptocurrency miners to generate random numbers to verify records stored on the blockchain – the technology underpinning digital currencies such as ethereum and the more popular bitcoin. Ethereum will instead use a “proof of stake” process, in which the network will be secured by users who “stake” sums of the cryptocurrency, committing themselves to acting honestly at the risk of losing it. De Vries said the switchover would eliminate the majority of electricity usage. “They could cut off a huge chunk of their power demand. I will be working on quantifying that more accurately but at least 99% (probably even 99.9%) reduction should be achievable. This translates to something like the electricity consumption of a country like Portugal (a quarter of all data centres in the world combined) vanishing overnight.” The proof-of-stake model is currently being used on an experimental “beacon” blockchain, where it has been tested to ensure that the theoretical security it provides is sufficient for the multibillion-dollar economy that sits on top of the ethereum network. Now the experimental blockchain will take over the work of the main network. “Imagine ethereum is a spaceship that isn’t quite ready for an interstellar voyage,” the ethereum foundation said, explaining the merge. “With the beacon chain, the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After significant testing, it’s almost time to hot-swap the new engine for the old midflight. This will merge the new, more efficient engine into the existing ship, ready to put in some serious lightyears and take on the universe.” There are still potential problems ahead. The foundation said users needed to watch out for an increase in scam activity because hackers could take advantage of the confusion around the switchover to try to trick users into giving up their passwords, their funds or both. “You should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition,” the organisation said. “Do not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to ‘upgrade to ETH2’. There is no ETH2 token, and there is nothing more you need to do for your funds to remain safe.” The final stages of the merge are expected to begin on 6 September, the foundation said, with the old blockchain switched off at some point between 10 and 20 September. Ethereum will not be the first network to use proof of stake, and others including cardano and solana have demonstrated the technology at a smaller scale. But its switchover will leave bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, facing renewed criticism for its continued reliance on proof of work. The bitcoin network uses 130TWh of electricity a year, De Vries estimates, a sum that will be increasingly difficult to defend if the ethereum blockchain demonstrates that the same capabilities can be achieved in an environmentally friendly manner.","publicationTime":1661777718.000000000,"title":"Cryptocurrency ethereum plans to cut carbon emissions by 99% with upgrade","id":"technology/2022/aug/29/cryptocurrency-ethereum-plans-to-cut-carbon-emissions-by-99-per-cent-with-upgrade"},{"body":"The FTX cryptocurrency exchange has collapsed with at least $1bn in investor assets lost.

Heat players and staff will be able to be paid in bitcoin from Friday, while the club is also expected to accept bitcoin payments for sponsorships, merchandise and ballpark concessions on game days. “This is the first time a sports club has decided to go all in on a bitcoin standard,” the club’s CEO, Steven Nelkovski, told Guardian Australia. The bitcoin payments were not mandatory, Nelkovski said, but all current employees of the club were on board with the scheme. Should a player wish to opt out, they can still be paid in the traditional manner, with their salary transferred to Australian dollars and sent to their bank account as with any other direct debit process. There is also the option to be paid partially in bitcoin and traditional dollars. “We are giving the players the freedom to decide what is best for their unique situation,” Nelkovski said. “The entire process is very similar to the traditional payments process with one added variable which is how much of their salary they would like to keep in bitcoin.” Nelkovski said the deal did not need to be ratified by Baseball Australia, which has been supportive of the move. BA, the game’s national governing body, was contacted for comment. A new position of chief bitcoin officer has been created by the club – filled by Patrick O’Sullivan – to facilitate the new operation and the shift of “the corporate treasury” from dollars to cryptocurrency. “This is not a one-off purchase to hedge against future uncertainties or inflationary pressures,” said O’Sullivan. “The Perth Heat are embracing the reality that the future of money and corporate treasuries will live on the bitcoin blockchain.” In a team statement, the Heat claimed it was the first professional sports club in the world to “fully embrace bitcoin and the Lightning Network for payment acceptance and payroll for staff and players”. Several American sports stars are known to have elected to exchange a portion or all of their salary to bitcoin, but those payments were initiated by the players themselves, rather than from the top down. The Heat are one of Australian baseball’s most successful clubs and have won four ABL championships since the formation of the league in 2010. Nelkovski said he believed the sponsorship deal would enable the organisation to reach new levels of success both on and off the field. “We firmly believe that the mindset that bitcoin imparts on network participants will be felt by our players, coaches, staff, and our loyal fanbase,” Nelkovski said. The 2021-22 ABL season, which was initially scheduled to start on Thursday this week, was last month cancelled for the second straight year to due disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.","publicationTime":1637132446.000000000,"title":"Australian Baseball League club Perth Heat to pay players in bitcoin","id":"sport/2021/nov/17/australian-baseball-league-club-perth-heat-to-pay-players-in-bitcoin"},{"body":"Jack Dorsey is resigning from Twitter to spend more time with his other company, Square. In some ways, the choice between Twitter and Square is a straight choice between political clout and profit. Square, a payments platform co-founded by Dorsey in 2009, is worth almost three times Twitter’s current value at about $97bn (£73bn). But Square will never be credited with the equivalent of the “Twitter revolution”, or make headlines by banning a former president. Venture capital is pouring money into cryptocurrencies and payment platforms. Twitter, by contrast, having only started to become profitable since 2018, has always been more notable for its political impact than its commercial pull. However, Twitter, like the wider social industry of which it is a part, may be experiencing the limits of its growth. In terms of commercial reach, Twitter is no competition for industry giants such as Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok, which each have well over a billion users. But even Facebook and Instagram are slowing down. Generation Z is turning off the major platforms. Downloads of Facebook and Instagram have been declining, according to a Bank of America report published in 2019. Both Twitter and Facebook have been losing ground with businesses due to this demographic shift in demand. By capitalising on the rise of video-sharing, TikTok has captured a much younger audience than Facebook or Twitter. Some businesses are also abandoning social media entirely, from fashion house Bottega Veneta, to Tesla, Lush and JD Wetherspoon. It makes sense that investors are looking for the next big thing from tech, and that social media bosses would be searching for ways to profit from the cryptocurrency bubble. Before he left, Dorsey had been trying to expand Twitter into offering crypto-based payments and non-fungible token services. His replacement as CEO, Parag Agrawal, was tasked with developing Twitter’s crypto strategy, and it seems likely that Twitter will continue to plough that field. Twitter is not the only social media firm attempting to exploit such opportunities. Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has been trying to launch a cryptocurrency that could be sent worldwide via Facebook products, so far to no avail. This move makes more sense for a platform like Facebook, given that it has always offered a patchwork of services, such as video, photo, fan pages, gaming, buying and selling, and so on, compared with Twitter’s straightforward microblogging service. However, this isn’t just about profitability. It is about the economic power of belief. Dorsey is also a cryptocurrency fanatic. A particular champion of bitcoin, he claims it will one day “unite a deeply divided country” behind it, and eventually become the world’s “single currency”. Square accepts payments on its cash app from bitcoin, but no other cryptocurrency. Recently, Square released a white paper for a decentralised bitcoin exchange platform that would appear to freeze out competing cryptocurrencies. Dorsey is also a doom-monger about fiat currencies – those issued by governments. “Hyperinflation,” he oracularly warns, “is going to change everything. It’s happening.” This is baseless. Recent inflationary pressures due to the increased costs of production and transit caused by Covid and extreme weather patterns are real. But there is no hyperinflation in the global economy. Given Dorsey’s profile and potential impact on investors, it could be considered a reckless thing to say; but it also reflects the strange ideology of all bitcoin enthusiasts. According to its devotees, bitcoin is a deflationary force that routes around the inefficiencies and tyrannies of central banks and fiat currencies. It is deflationary because it is designed to mimic the supply of a real-world commodity, gold. This means that the number of coins that it is possible to mine is restricted: the supply will eventually hit a ceiling with 21m bitcoins. So even though, as the People’s Bank of China recently noted, the digital coin is not backed up by any real value, it operates as its own virtual gold standard. Moreover, bitcoin’s apologists say, decentralised blockchain technology cuts out all middle men, a principle that can be deployed in gaming, finance and social networks. It makes transactions cheaper and faster and keeps efficient records without the oversight of a big state. The advantage of this “upstart” libertarian ideology is that it chimes directly with the commercial interests of bitcoin investors. Currently, one bitcoin will trade for £42,973. But it wouldn’t be worth a dime if enough investors hadn’t decided to treat it as though it were gold. It is a “hyperstition”: a fiction that makes itself true because enough people believe in it. All currencies rely on what Michel de Certeau called a “secret network” of believers. We all must believe, not only in the value of the currency we exchange, but that others believe in it too. We look to a higher power, typically the central bank, to guarantee this belief. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the tech itself is supposed to eliminate the need for all these elaborate systems. This is typical of the “California ideology”, which blends the values of the libertarian right with the countercultural ethos of some of the internet’s pioneers. Yet, far from driving any great disruption, the value of cryptocurrencies is mainly a byproduct of developments in fiat currencies. The latter benefited from a glut of spare investment capital caused by the institutionalisation of quantitative easing. The crypto boom since Covid has therefore been made possible by central banks sending money supply through the roof. Ironically, the cryptocurrencies have benefited from precisely the sort of central bank policies that the libertarian right tends to complain about. Dorsey’s belief in a single global cryptocurrency is not likely to happen. And, as the economist Yanis Varoufakis has pointed out, it would actually be disastrous if bitcoin did replace fiat currencies. The “bitcoin community” would have no incentive to expand the money supply in the event of a crisis. That scenario would benefit the rich holders of the coin, such as tech monopolists, investment bankers and energy oligarchs, while wrecking the lives of everyone else. Nonetheless, we would be fools to underestimate belief backed up by spare investment capital. Since at least 2017, when a bitcoin was trading at less than $1,000 (£750), there have been a glut of articles explaining why the bitcoin bubble is unsustainable. But, far from falling apart, it continues to surge. Even after Elon Musk dropped the coin earlier this year, and China banned traders from offering bitcoin prices, its tradeable value climbed. The total value of cryptocurrencies today is close to $3tn. With Amazon looking to accept payment in bitcoins, there is space for further growth. Dorsey’s messianic belief in the power of crypto will probably be rewarded with profit for some time, in a way that the hype around Twitter never was. If we underestimate the economic value of belief, we will underestimate how large the bubble can grow.

His research shows that while the increase in a cryptocurrency’s price encourages more computer capacity to be dedicated to it – increasing carbon emissions – that capacity takes a long time to disappear after the value declines, so the climate impact persists. Cryptocurrencies work by validating their transactions through huge numbers of “miners”, who use their computers to solve extremely complex maths problems in exchange for the chance of getting tokens as a reward, in a highly energy-intensive process. De Vries estimates that the bitcoin network uses about 204 terrawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, around the same as the energy consumption of Thailand and above that of all but 23 sovereign nations. Other cryptocurrencies add to that footprint: ethereum, the token that underpins the NFT boom and the “decentralised finance” sector, has an annualised footprint of around 104TWh (equivalent to Kazakhstan, more than all but 34 nations), while even dogecoin, a lighthearted spinoff of bitcoin famed for its community’s positive attitude, consumes an estimated 4TWh annually. Those figures have barely changed over the past month despite $1tn being wiped off the crypto sector, and other measures of the amount of processing power devoted to “mining” similarly show little decline. All major cryptocurrencies use electrical power in rough proportion to the price of the token because that dictates how much the reward given to miners is worth. For bitcoin, for instance, the reward for successful mining is 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes – currently, about $210,000. The higher the value of the reward, the more energy it is worth using to try to win it, ensuring that as the price of bitcoin rose from $8,000 in October 2019 to $60,000 two years later, the energy use of the sector rose too, from 73TWh to its current high. But while an increase in the price of cryptocurrency quickly leads to an increase in the carbon emissions of the sector, a crash like the one seen in past month doesn’t do the reverse. “It likely stops the environmental impact from going up any further,” said de Vries, “but a bitcoin price of $25,200 is sufficient to sustain an annual electricity consumption of 184TWh.” That’s because the cost of cryptocurrency mining is split over two main areas: buying the hardware, and paying for electricity. When prices are on the rise, miners buy new computers – expensive graphics cards for ethereum, or purpose-built “rigs” for bitcoin – but once they are already set up, it’s worth switching them off only when the cost of electricity alone is higher than the expected revenue. In a paper published in the journal Joule last year, de Vries estimated that a massive crash in the price of bitcoin, back down to $8,000, would be required to meaningfully reduce the total emissions of mining – and even then, it could sustain an energy consumption of up to 60TWh per year. The continued turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets means the sector may have further to contract. On Wednesday morning, tether, a stablecoin that effectively functions as a bank, paid out a further $1.5bn to depositors withdrawing their cash from its coffers. In the past week, the slow-motion bank run has seen $9bn of its reserves withdrawn, more than 10% of its total market cap and well over twice the cash-on-hand it declared it had at the beginning of the year. Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm and one of the key financial backers of the cryptocurrency sector, said on Tuesday that we may be entering a “crypto winter”, echoing a warning from the Coinbase chief executive, Brian Armstrong, that valuations may be depressed for some time.","publicationTime":1652887540.000000000,"title":"Crypto crash unlikely to reduce its climate impact, expert says","id":"technology/2022/may/18/crypto-crash-unlikely-to-reduce-its-climate-impact-expert-says"},{"body":"El Faro has survived many pressures in its 25 years reporting on El Salvador’s bloody drug wars, crime and institutional corruption. “We’ve been harassed. We’ve received death threats from drug cartels, requiring us to contract armed security guards. And we’ve had the police coming to our houses after we revealed their corruption scandals,” said Óscar Martínez, editor of the online investigative outlet. “Some of our journalists have been exiled, but we have managed to continue reporting from San Salvador.” Now, the digital publication says it is leaving the Central American country to escape a ratcheting clampdown on press freedom by its increasingly dictatorial president, Nayib Bukele. El Faro is moving its headquarters to San José, Costa Rica, to avoid what it says are “fabricated accusations” from the government intended to shut them down. “This time we have no choice but to leave because it’s not one group that is after us. It is the entire state,” said Martínez. Under Bukele’s rule, human rights watchdogs have warned of a steady erosion of El Salvador’s democracy. The strongman’s hard line on crime has brought him mass popularity at home, but observers say at a great cost to human rights. The Bukele government has marched armed soldiers into a court hearing, stacked the country’s judicial systems with loyalists and ruled with emergency powers for more than a year, incarcerating so many people that it had to build a new megaprison. “Bukele is an autocrat on steroids,” said Carolina Jiménez Sandoval, president of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). “The speed with which he has co-opted all levels of power, in just one presidential period, is astonishing.” As the millennial leader has concentrated his power he has also curtailed the freedom of the press. The Bukele government introduced a law that can jail journalists for 15 years for reporting on the country’s drug-trafficking gangs and at least 22 Salvadoran journalists – most of whom report for El Faro – have had their phones tapped with the aggressive Israeli spyware Pegasus. Bukele’s attacks on the media are part of his strategy to control the narrative inside and outside the country as he tries to brand El Salvador as a safe, tropical bitcoin-friendly paradise, said Mario Gómez, a Salvadoran software engineer who fled the capital in 2021. Gómez was detained by the national police after criticising a law which obliged all Salvadorans to accept the cryptocurrency. “It’s really hard to show what is going on in El Salvador when you have a propaganda machine making sure the reality that journalists or in fact anyone wants to say about the government is delegitimised,” he said. While some Salvadoran media have been pressured into self-censorship or shutting down entirely, El Faro continues to expose a number of high-profile scandals, putting it in the crosshairs of the government. “We know that the government is running polygraph tests on officials to see if they have spoken with us,” said Martínez. Among the publication’s investigations it has revealed a controversial deal the government brokered with powerful gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for not extraditing crime bosses to the US. In response, the Bukele administration is “threatening, surveilling and defaming El Faro” to force it out of the country, the publication said in a statement. “The president even used state television and radio to falsely accuse us of money laundering.” Though Martínez said the accusations are entirely baseless, the editors fear they cannot defend themselves in a state which no longer has rule of law. “This is a country that no longer has a separation of powers, a country where one man alone controls those powers, and that man has accused us directly of money laundering. This makes it impossible for us to defend ourselves,” the editor said. “This is an aggressive step to protect our journalists and what our journalists do.” While El Faro is relocating, it says it will keep as much of its team in the country as possible. “Though this is a blow editorially, we will continue working independently and critically to expose the Bukele regime,” said Martínez. “We leave as a way to stay.”","publicationTime":1681896635.000000000,"title":"El Salvador news outlet relocates to Costa Rica to avoid Bukele’s crackdown","id":"world/2023/apr/19/el-faro-el-salvador-moves-nayib-bukele"},{"body":"In the gloom of an 18th-century drawing room at the private rehab clinic Castle Craig, near Peebles in the Scottish Borders, Roy, a 29-year-old victim of the global cryptocurrency crash, tells me his story. It is a dazzling summer’s day, but here the mood is sombre. Roy shifts uncomfortably in his chair as he begins. It all started in February 2021, with a radio advert for Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency promoted by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla. Intrigued, Roy started Googling, eventually using his credit card to make an initial investment of €2,500 (£2,200) in a range of cryptocurrencies. The value of Roy’s portfolio climbed to €8,000, then €100,000, then €525,000. Roy had entered the market during an adrenalised bull run, meaning an extended period of price growth. A combination of Covid stimulus packages, low interest rates and an unprecedented level of enthusiasm for cryptocurrency among furloughed workers meant the bull was careering out of sight. Roy started spending all his time watching YouTube videos and speaking to other cryptocurrency enthusiasts in private groups on the messaging app Telegram. He had been treated for cocaine and alcohol addiction twice, but by 2021 he was sober and working as an addiction counsellor, although he was on sick leave as a result of panic attacks brought on by childhood trauma. He soon relapsed. By day, he checked his cryptocurrency wallets every 10 seconds; by night, he set alarms to go off on the hour. He began fantasising about a life free of financial constraints, in which he would never have to work. “I thought I was on top of the world,” Roy says. “Nobody could tell me anything. Money would fix every single problem I faced from now on.” Then the cryptocurrency market crashed. The price of bitcoin fell from £42,000 in May 2021 to £23,000 by the end of June. It rallied to an all-time high of £48,000 in November, before diving to £26,000 at the end of January. Since then, it has been in near-continuous freefall. At the time of writing, bitcoin is hovering at £17,000. “It felt like I had lost my life,” says Roy. “Because I had invested everything in crypto. I had built every dream I had on there. So, when it came crashing down, my whole life came crashing down.” Desperate, Roy made a string of bad bets. The value of his portfolio dwindled to €20,000, then €3,000. “It got so out of control because I saw all my chances to live a better life fading away,” he says. “So I became really desperate and eventually just completely isolated. I didn’t want to see anybody, because I thought I was a failure.” Most mornings, he would wake up shaking from alcohol withdrawal, order booze online and spend the day drinking and taking drugs. He developed stomach ulcers. “You can’t explain the pain,” he says. “I would drink and puke and drink and puke and drink and hope to keep it in, so the pain would go away. I felt like dying.” In May, jobless and broke, Roy checked into Castle Craig, one of the only centres in the world that treats cryptocurrency addiction. (He lost his job when he relapsed; his rehab fees are covered by medical insurance.) His cryptocurrency portfolio is worth about €300. Now, amid the incongruous grandeur of a Scottish stately home, he is attempting to rebuild his life – and quieten the tormenting thought that he should have pulled out his money when he had the chance. “It’s heartbreaking,” Roy says, softly. “I hate myself for the fact that I didn’t take it out.” *** They gather on Telegram to let out howls of grief and short, sharp shrieks of pain. “Eeeeeeee!” yowls a young woman. “Waahahahah,” roars a man in a deep baritone. A third person wails like a baby. These are victims of the cryptocurrency bloodbath, 3,315 of whom have assembled in a “Bear Market Screaming Therapy Group” group to vent their anguish. “I had a few people lamenting and crying,” says the group’s founder, a 30-year-old cryptocurrency investor who gives only his first name, Giulio. “I decided not to ban them. I felt bad. They weren’t even able to scream any more. They were just sobbing.” The cryptocurrency industry is in roiling waters. Scarcely a day seems to pass without a wave crashing across the sector. “The rollercoaster has turned and taken crypto holders on a downward spiral,” says Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Many people have been caused serious financial pain.” Last month, major coins including bitcoin and ethereum dropped by more than one-third in just a week. While bitcoin has tumbled significantly on several occasions, this bear run – meaning a period of declining prices – feels different. The industry is larger and more interconnected than ever, with retail and institutional investors jostling for space in what was, until last year, a $3tn market. (The crash has wiped $2tn off the market’s value.) In May, the “stablecoin” terra/luna collapsed, prompting the Guardian’s UK technology editor, Alex Hern, to ask whether this was the industry’s “Lehman Brothers moment”. It had been marketed as a safe bet, due to the fact it was pegged to the US dollar, and promised returns of up to 20%. The carnage prompted further sell-offs. This month, the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network halted withdrawals for its 1.7 million customers, citing “extreme market conditions”. A day later, Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced that it was sacking 18% of its workforce. At the end of June, the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which was heavily leveraged in cryptocurrency and related businesses, went into liquidation. Everywhere is panic and turmoil – and things look likely to get worse. The casualties range from ordinary retail investors to multimillionaire “whales” and celebrities – in May, the British rapper KSI tweeted that he had lost almost $3m in the terra/luna crash. There have been at least two reported suicides, in the UK and Taiwan; on the Reddit community for terra/luna investors, users share details of suicide hotlines. Advocates argue that this is but a cryptocurrency winter, as seen in 2013 and 2018. Prices will rebound; spring will turn to summer; the bear becomes the bull. They lampoon so-called “paper-hands” investors, meaning those who abscond at the first sign of trouble, and urge each other to Hodl (“hold on for dear life”) and “buy the dip” (purchase coins when prices are low). Others are less certain. Will the frost ever thaw? *** There are eight stages of crypto-crash grief. Shock. “I couldn’t eat or sleep for two nights,” says Alla Driksne, a 34-year-old chef from London. “I got sick from the stress.” She has lost her life savings – a six-figure sum – in the Celsius freeze. Denial. “I always thought the next project would bring me back up again and I’d cash out before it crashed,” says Roy. “In the next cycle, I’m going to try. In the next cycle, I’m going to do it again.” A part of him still believes this is possible. Anger. Alex Koh, a 41-year-old engineer and personal finance YouTuber from Glasgow, directs his towards Do Kwon, the South Korean entrepreneur who founded terra/luna. Koh says he lost enough to buy a four-bedroom house in London. Kwon has been accused of fraud by five investors based in South Korea; he is being investigated there by a financial crimes unit and in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bargaining. Vahid, a 31-year-old from London, has used Twitter to plead for his money with Alex Mashinsky, the founder of Celsius. Vahid’s life savings, more than £50,000 in cryptocurrency, is locked in his Celsius account. Vahid had planned to use the money to start a business or buy a house. For support, he spends his time on conference calls with other Celsius victims; I listen in to one. “I know anything short of getting your native token [initial investment] back is unacceptable,” says one investor, with desperation in his voice. “But would you rather get back 10%, or 20%, or 34%, you know? Now, I’m hoping it’s not a complete loss.” Depression. “I thought I’d be able to retire early,” says Koh. “But it’s all gone down the drain. I’ve never cried so much in my life.” Acceptance and hope. “I worked my ass off doing 16-hour days for six years to earn this money,” says Driksne. “This is hard-earned money. That’s what hurts the most. I lost six years of hard work. But I am trying to stay positive. I’ll make it back again.” Shame. Vahid hasn’t told anyone he has lost his life savings. “I don’t want people turning around to me, saying: you should have taken your money out last year,” he says. I ask him if he is embarrassed. “Of course,” he responds. Processing. “I hope that I can show that I am willing to learn and accept my mistakes,” says Koh. “If I rebound from this, perhaps I can be an inspiration to people elsewhere around the world – or my kids, at least.” *** The industry’s enthusiasts and sceptics agree on one thing: they saw this coming. Perhaps they didn’t predict the precise contours of the crash, or the fact that so many seemingly reputable companies would flame out, but there was a sense that the cryptocurrency bull would run out of road. The sector was too hot, too loaded with bad-faith actors, scammers, credulous investors and amateurs feigning expertise in Telegram groups, YouTube videos and Twitter threads. When internet jokes such as PooCoin and Dogecoin surged in popularity, it ought to have been apparent that a market correction was coming. Such stupidity cannot be sustained for long. “Was it surprising?” says Dr Larisa Yarovaya, an associate professor of finance at the University of Southampton. “I think it was quite predictable.” The Bank of England has repeatedly told cryptocurrency investors to be prepared to lose all their money. Investors bought bitcoin as a speculative punt in 2020 and 2021 because interest rates were low and many had spare cash due to lockdowns and economic stimulus packages. But when interest rates and inflation began to rise, fuelled by Covid‑affected supply chains and the war in Ukraine, institutional investors preferred to put their money into safer assets. “There is a fear factor rippling through financial markets about how out of control inflation is and whether central banks will be able to bring it under control,” says Hargreaves Lansdown’s Streeter. “When people feel richer, they are more likely to spend on riskier assets, like crypto. But in times of uncertainty, investors flee to safer havens.” The mania around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was fuelled by a social media hype machine unprecedented in the history of financial markets. Investors touted new coins that were amassing huge returns, hung off the tweets of crypto-influencers and spoke in impenetrable jargon. “Demand for bitcoin related purely to the level of interest in this new technology, and that interest was manipulated by the companies that offered different cryptocurrencies and exchanges and startups,” Yarovaya says. “All of this happened on social media, meaning that investors didn’t even know whether there was genuine interest in crypto, or lots of Twitter bots encouraging people to buy. The system wasn’t transparent.” Koh got swept up in the social media frenzy. “You fall into this dream, this La-La land of thinking: I’m going to make it. It was like a whole trend, a pop culture. Now, sitting back, I think we got brainwashed.” Koh’s wife has a master’s degree in business administration and she urged him to be cautious. “She said: ‘Alex, it sounds like a Ponzi scheme … this is social media marketing to rope you in; take your liquidity and go.’” But he didn’t listen. “They call it ‘being an alpha’,” he says. “You have to be on Twitter, and follow the right people, and be in the right Discord channel. You listen to the right chatrooms. It makes you feel so special.” At one point, says Koh, he convinced himself that terra/luna was such a great project that he “was ready to sell my house, my car, put everything in”. Now, he wouldn’t invest even £10 in cryptocurrencies. “It’s like a drug,” Koh says. “You’ve been there. You got high. And then you’re in rehab. I’m not going to go back in again.” His greatest regret is that he encouraged others to invest in the terra/luna project. His YouTube channel, which has 17,600 subscribers, repeatedly championed the cryptocurrency. “I do feel responsible,” Koh says. “I don’t know what to do. How much I apologise. I haven’t got much hate, because I think I’ve been quite transparent in how much I’ve lost. I am not saying people forgive, though. I don’t forgive myself for it.” *** Has the great cryptocurrency revolution simply evaporated? Nassim Nicholas Taleb was once open-minded about the potential of cryptocurrencies. The risk engineering professor originated the theory of the “black swan”: a hard-to-predict but seismic event, such as the 2008 financial crash, that is often rationalised after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. In 2018, Taleb wrote an essay describing bitcoin as “an excellent idea” and a possible “insurance policy against an Orwellian future”. Last year, Taleb revised his position in a paper that described bitcoin’s value as “zero”. “This is the first time we’ve seen a financial bubble coupled with religious, cult‑like behaviour and an investment strategy not seen before in history,” he says. Many demur – and Taleb could yet be proved wrong. A common defence of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that the underlying technology, blockchain, has functions not yet discovered. Taleb says: “I would tell people who are still holding bitcoin: ask your grandmother if the idea makes sense. And if it doesn’t make sense to her, it doesn’t make sense … get out. Do something productive with your life.” But few in the cryptocurrency world are heeding the esteemed professor’s advice. Driksne plans to invest in cryptocurrency in the future, despite her six-figure loss, although she would steer clear of platforms such as Celsius. “I firmly believe crypto is the future,” agrees Vahid. “It’s not a Ponzi scheme or a scam.” He compares cryptocurrency to the early days of Amazon and Google. When I point out that they were growing businesses, unlike bitcoin, Vahid says: “But bitcoin replaces gold. Bitcoin is digital gold.” Taleb is exasperated by this line of reasoning. “If you buy gold and store it in your basement or wear it on your neck, there is no chance of that gold turning to lead over any foreseeable horizon,” says Taleb. “Metals don’t need maintenance. Bitcoin requires continuous maintenance.” It may be that future economists view the cryptocurrency boom of the early 2020s as a mass Dunning-Kruger event, fuelled by social media and facilitated by technology; an era in which amateurs took financial advice from fellow amateurs and bet the house on speculative investments. “Admitting that you know nothing just tells you that you’re lucky,” says Roy. “And my ego couldn’t handle that. I didn’t want to be lucky. I wanted to be someone who knew what they were doing. I’m smart, right? Tell me I’m smart, please? That’s how it goes. The whole community reinforced themselves, and each other.” When Taleb published his 2021 paper, he received so much abuse that he had to lock his Twitter account. “I could not believe how psychopathic bitcoin people were,” says Taleb. Watching his tormentors have their portfolios wiped out has provoked a degree of schadenfreude, he admits. But he has compassion for the inexperienced investors who got swept up in the hype. “Lots of these kids lost everything they have,” he says. “You feel empathy for them.” The scammers, who urged others to invest in doomed projects while they were secretly cashing out? “They must be punished,” Taleb says. But it seems likely that, just as in the 2008 financial crash, the bad-faith actors who exacerbated this meltdown will walk away unscathed. What’s more, many of the investors who bought into the cryptocurrency boom did so to claw back security after a decade racked by recession and uncertainty. Koh was one of those. “I was lucky to keep my job, but I was really angry at the suits, at the bankers, at the high‑bonus people,” he says. “The whole space of crypto was about giving normal people the option to gain the upper edge in society financially. It was a beacon of hope. We could ride the next big thing. But that beacon of hope has been put out for now. The trust has been broken. Yet again, sitting here, in decade number two, the bankers have won again.” Future generations may look back at this boom as a period of mania, when money multiplied like bacteria and a collective delusion gripped financial markets. It may seem unfathomable, but it shouldn’t. After all, who doesn’t want to be rich?

Likening the growth of cryptocurrencies to the spiralling value of US sub-prime mortgages before the 2008 financial crash, the deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe said there was danger financial markets could be rocked in a few years by an event of similar magnitude. Bitcoin and its nearest rival, Ethereum, tumbled in value earlier this year but have recovered ground to reach towards all-time highs. Only five years ago a single bitcoin was worth about $700 (£513) compared with $56,000 (£41,000) today. Ethereum has almost doubled in value since July to $3,500. Cunliffe has played a central role in monitoring cryptocurrencies over recent years as an adviser to the G20’s financial stability board and the central banks’ overarching advisory body, the Geneva-based Bank of International Settlements. A highly respected former Whitehall mandarin with contacts in political and central bank circles, his warning is likely to grab the attention of senior treasury officials in the UK, Washington and Tokyo. Cryptocurrency coins have grown in value by about 200% this year, from just under $800bn to $2.3tn, and have risen from $16bn five years ago. Cunliffe said that while the finance industry was more robust than in 2008 and that governments should be wary of overreacting to financial innovations, there were reasons to be concerned about traders using digital currencies that could be worthless overnight. “Of course $2.3tn needs to be seen in the context of the $250tn global financial system. But as the financial crisis showed us, you don’t have to account for a large proportion of the financial sector to trigger financial stability problems – sub-prime was valued at about $1.2tn in 2008,” he said. Speculation in sub-prime mortgages in the US was driven by low-income households using mortgages with ultra-low interest rates. Cunliffe said there was evidence that speculators were beginning to borrow money to buy crypto assets, heightening the risk of a crash infecting the broader financial system. At the moment surveys suggested that spending on cryptocurrencies was backed with only about $40bn of borrowed funds. But there was evidence traders were increasingly speculating on the future value of digital currencies. He said traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were handling $2bn of crypto purchases a day and the popularity of futures trading was attracting hedge funds and other speculators. “The bulk of these assets have no intrinsic value and are vulnerable to major price corrections. The crypto world is beginning to connect to the traditional financial system and we are seeing the emergence of leveraged players. And, crucially, this is happening in largely unregulated space,” Cunliffe said. “Financial stability risks currently are relatively limited but they could grow very rapidly if, as I expect, this area continues to develop and expand at pace. How large those risks could grow will depend in no small part on the nature and on the speed of the response by regulatory and supervisory authorities,” he added. There was also a growing conflict between the need to develop standards in “a painstaking, careful process” and the rapid growth of digital trading. Cunliffe said guidance drafted by the bodies that regulate global financial markets had taken two years to write, during which time trading platforms for digital currencies had expanded sixteen fold.","publicationTime":1634143725.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin could trigger financial meltdown, warns Bank of England deputy","id":"technology/2021/oct/13/bitcoin-could-trigger-financial-meltdown-warns-bank-of-england-deputy"},{"body":"A single bitcoin transaction generates the same amount of electronic waste as throwing two iPhones in the bin, according to a new analysis by economists from the Dutch central bank and MIT. While the carbon footprint of bitcoin is well studied, less attention has been paid to the vast churn in computer hardware that the cryptocurrency incentivises. Specialised computer chips called ASICs are sold with no other purpose than to run the algorithms that secure the bitcoin network, a process called mining that rewards those who partake with bitcoin payouts. But because only the newest chips are power-efficient enough to mine profitably, effective miners need to constantly replace their ASICs with newer, more powerful ones. “The lifespan of bitcoin mining devices remains limited to just 1.29 years,” write the researchers Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll in the paper, Bitcoin’s growing e-waste problem, published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling. “As a result, we estimate that the whole bitcoin network currently cycles through 30.7 metric kilotons of equipment per year. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands.” In 2020 the bitcoin network processed 112.5m transactions (compared with 539bn processed by traditional payment service providers in 2019), according to the economists, meaning that each individual transaction “equates to at least 272g of e-waste”. That’s the weight of two iPhone 12 minis. The reason why e-waste is such a problem for the cryptocurrency is that, unlike most computing hardware, ASICs have no alternative use beyond bitcoin mining, and if they cannot be used to mine bitcoin profitably, they have no future purpose at all. It is theoretically possible for these devices to regain the ability to operate profitably at a later point in time should bitcoin prices suddenly increase and drive up mining income, the authors note. “Nonetheless, there are several factors that generally prevent substantial extension of the lifetime of mining devices,” they add. Storing mining hardware costs money, and the longer it is stored for, the less likely it is that it will ever be profitable. The authors also warn that the e-waste problem will probably grow further if the price of bitcoin continues to rise, since it will incentivise further investment in and replacement of ASIC hardware. If the community were to try to reduce its e-waste problem, the paper concludes, it would need to replace the bitcoin mining process in “its entirety with a more sustainable alternative”, and the paper suggests “proof of stake”, an experimental replacement. Ethereum, a bitcoin successor, announced in May plans to move to proof of stake within months, although the switchover has yet to occur. Other bitcoin alternatives have been less successful at limiting their environmental footprint. Chia, a cryptocurrency that is built on a “proof of time and space” algorithm, has been accused of leading to shortages in hard drives and SSDs, a type of storage medium popular in fast computers. “Instead of just wasting electricity, Chia chews through SSDs at a fantastic rate and also has thoroughly wrecked the market for big HDs,” said David Gerard, a cryptocurrency expert.","publicationTime":1631858437.000000000,"title":"Waste from one bitcoin transaction ‘like binning two iPhones’","id":"technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones"},{"body":"That’s our work here done for today.

Anthony Albanese calls Scott Morrison’s Pep-11 actions ‘dishonest’ and ‘incompetent’ AAP is reporting on the ongoing fallout from that time Scott Morrison got himself sworn into a swag of portfolios: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has described his predecessor’s decision to halt a gas drilling project off the NSW coast, triggering a legal fight, as “dishonest” and “incompetent”. The federal government and energy company Asset Energy have agreed to end their legal battle over Morrison’s decision, by proposing consent orders to the court. Asset Energy launched a legal challenge to the Pep-11 decision last year, saying Morrison breached the requirements of procedural fairness and that he was not validly appointed as the responsible minister of the joint authority. Albanese said: What I won’t do is do what the former government did, and essentially create a situation whereby legally, it wasn’t tenable. This situation has arisen because of the incompetence and the dishonesty of the Morrison government. Morrison used additional powers he had gained by swearing himself in as resources minister to intervene in the Pep-11 decision and veto it in 2021. “No one was told that Scott Morrison was sworn in as the resources minister, in order to override Keith Pitt as resources minister. That’s how we got into this debacle where the company has made legal action against the federal government,” Albanese said. Petroleum Exploration Permit 11, known as Pep-11, is a petroleum well off the NSW coast between Wollongong and Newcastle, covering about 8,200 sq km. If the court accepts the orders, Morrison’s decision would be overturned and put back to the Commonwealth-NSW Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority for consideration, the federal government said on Friday. The federal and NSW state governments are both members of the decision-making authority. -AAP OK, enough with the colourful pics (for now, anyway).

New York man heads off on dream holiday to Sydney, Australia only to end up in Sidney, Montana A New York man heading off on a dream holiday to Sydney, Australia to take a cruise got the shock of his life when he looked out of the plane window to see snow-capped mountains rather than the golden sands of Bondi beach. “I saw a mountaintop covered in white snow. At that point, I knew I was in trouble,” Kingsley Burnett, 62, told local TV channel KTVQ after he realised he had booked and caught a flight to the tiny Montana city of Sidney rather than the Australian city. “It’s a matter of acronyms. The S-Y-D as opposed to S-D-Y. Somebody has to fix that,” Burnett said, explaining how a mix-up over airport codes had led to his unfortunate mistake that had landed him in Billings, Montana, as a tiny jet waited to make his connection to the wrong Sydney. Burnett also admitted to the TV station that he had been trying to be frugal for his trip and been pleasantly surprised at the cheapness of the flight he had found for his planned trip halfway across the globe. Police looking for truck driver who allegedly backed into police car South Australian police are hunting for a truck driver who allegedly backed into a police car, ramming its front at a traffic control stop before speeding away. Police stopped the small tipper truck off Lawrence Hargrave Way in Adelaide as it was allegedly not displaying a rear number plate on Thursday afternoon. As the officer was getting out of his car, the driver of the truck quickly reversed and collided with the front of the police vehicle, causing minor damage, police allege. The driver then sped off, they say. Police have released images of the vehicle, believed to be a 2007 Mitsubishi Canter tipper truck. -AAP Here is Guardian Australia’s weekend wrap of essential reads from the past seven days, selected by Imogen Dewey. WA Liberals have all-women leadership team after election of state president The Western Australian Liberal party has elected Caroline Di Russo as its state president, making for an all-women leadership team including the state leader, Libby Mettam, and WA federal leader, Michaelia Cash. The party was hammered at the 2021 state election, with Mettam and the former state leader David Honey being the only Liberal MPs left in the lower house. Mettam challenged for the leadership and took on the job on 30 January after Honey declined to contest the position. Di Russo, after her election at the party’s state council meeting on Saturday, said she looked forward to working closely with Mettam and Cash in preparation for the 2025 state and federal elections. “Our timeless Liberal values remain fit for purpose. They’re the answer to many of the challenges we must face as a country, and the key to unlocking the enormous potential of our great state and the people within it,” she said in a statement. “But only by electing more Liberal voices to parliament can our values have that positive impact.” Cash said Di Russo’s election as state president was well deserved. -AAP The ABC has apologised for broadcasting an “incomplete” picture of a community meeting in Alice Springs at which attenders were quoted claiming there was a “disgusting display of white supremacy”.

NSW Greens announce plan to deal with plastic recycling crisis The New South Wales Greens have proposed a solution to the soft plastics crisis, after supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths were ordered to dump more than 5,200 tonnes of soft plastic – currently being stored at warehouses across NSW – into landfill. Greens MP and the party’s waste spokesperson, Cate Faehrmann, unveiled the plan on Saturday, which includes immediately redirecting the entirety of the more than $800m a year waste levy “towards dealing with the waste crisis”. The Greens’ plan also includes dedicating $100m from the waste levy towards establishing soft plastics recycling schemes; establishing a “plastics reduction taskforce” to develop a soft plastics recycling strategy; mandating procurement targets for recycled plastic content in single use plastics as well as products like roads and pathways, railway bollards and street furniture, and expanding the trial of kerbside soft plastics recycling to Sydney. Faehrmann said the environment minister “needs to rule out this waste going to landfill”. She added: The minister needs to find a safe storage solution and invest in those businesses that already have soft plastic recycling schemes to be able to scale them up. The collapse of RedCycle and the discovery of millions of tonnes of stockpiled soft plastics that are now on their way to landfill has revealed a deeply broken plastics recycling system. The Greens’ plan will create a sustainable soft plastics recycling scheme that won’t disappear overnight. The community is crying out for options to recycle their waste, this should be a no brainer.

Here is a guide to spotting the rare celestial spectacle: Decision to allow MDMA and psilocybin to be prescribed is exciting, scientists says The CSIRO scientist Peter Duggan has been talking to the ABC about the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s decision to allow MDMA and psilocybin to be prescribed – it was big news that dropped late yesterday, but you can catch up here. Duggan said: It is very intriguing and exciting, but the exact way that these drugs work is still yet to be fully determined. They act on a particular serotonin receptor … serotonin is the feel happy drug, but if you are suffering from one of these serious depressive illnesses, anything that can improve your mood can be quite beneficial. These drugs work to improve your mood, and they do seem to have quite a long-lasting effect from one single dose, apparently. Only a limited number of psychiatrists would be prescribing them at first, he said, but that number would increase as more were trained up.

The six independents, who could hold the balance of power in under two months, will on Saturday unveil a bill that would amend the state planning act to ban certain types of development on land and at sea, negating possible future federal approval. “It’s remarkable that the federal Labor government would seek to overturn the only good environmental policy of the former Coalition government,” Greenwich said. Exclusive by Tamsin Rose: Psychiatrists to be allowed to prescribe MDMA and psilocybin After decades of “demonisation”, psychiatrists will be able to prescribe MDMA and psilocybin in Australia from July this year.

The poll, conducted by Ipsos for urban thinktank the Committee for Sydney, surveyed 1,000 people from across greater Sydney between 5 and 17 January, and found that 81% of Sydney residents are satisfied with their quality of life, which is up from 74% in 2022. That figure is 75% in New York City and 76% in London. Many believe life is improving in the city too – 37% said quality of life was better than 12 months ago, up from 19% in 2022 and 20% in 2021. However, 85% of the city is concerned about cost of living, a figure that has remained stubborn in recent years. The poll found a correlation between concern with cost of living and a poorer sense of quality of life. Sydneysiders are also returning to the office, with 33% of workers now commuting five days a week, up from 28% in 2022. There’s been a significant drop in the numbers working from home every day, with just 12% not going into the office at all, down from 30% in 2022. Of the more concerning findings, the poll found that 64% of residents in the north of Sydney agreed nightlife was safe, 61% in the eastern and city suburbs, but this figure dropped to 42% in the western suburbs. Ehssan Veiszadeh, the interim CEO of the Committee for Sydney, said “there’s a tremendous sense of confidence in the community heading into 2023” but that “the one outlier is access to affordable, decent housing, and cost of living”. When you break down the results, it’s clear people who are concerned about cost of living are more likely to be pessimistic about the future. A “mini-cyclone” has left significant damage across the coastal NSW city of Port Macquarie, with trees and powerlines downed and roofs ripped from buildings, AAP’s Phoebe Loomes reports. Multiple emergency crews responded after the sudden sudden storm hit the coastal city just after 3pm on Friday. Some 60 calls for help were made to the State Emergency Service in the 30 minutes to 4pm, with reports of roofs blown from buildings, fallen trees and requests for flood rescues. The number of calls had grown to 150 by 5.30pm, said Michael Ward from the Port Macquarie unit of the SES. “There are definitely roofs off buildings, there’s definitely significant damage to buildings in and around the Port Macquarie area,” Ward said. The SES was prioritising re-establishing safe access around the town, before focusing on clearing access to homes and businesses, he said. There have been no reports of significant injuries. People were being urged to stay well away from downed power lines and to stay at home unless travel was necessary. Winds ripped the roof from an apartment block at Hastings River Drive in the city, leaving frightened residents fleeing downstairs for cover, Fire and Rescue NSW said. A fallen tree also hit a house causing a roof to tear off a home in Hay Street. Firefighters were called to one of the city’s private hospitals after it was damaged in the storm. Vehicles were also hit by falling trees, including a truck and car which were both struck by downed gum trees on Murray Street, in separate incidents. Powerlines were also been downed in Hayward Street, where firefighters assisted. Local residents described the event as a “mini-tornado” and “mini-cyclone”, sharing images showing intense gusts and heavy rainfall. China has questions to answer over the “weather balloon”* (ahem, spy balloon) that has been zipping around US airspace, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, says. Marles, who is also defence minister, is in Washington discussing defence cooperation, Aukus and regional security with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. According to the Australian Financial Review, Marles said he didn’t know more about the balloon than what was already public, and he was unaware of anything similar over Australia. He said: There are a lot of questions associated with it, which I think everyone has. We all want the answers to those questions from China. * (China’s claim it was just a weather balloon have been described as a “laughable alibi”).

Read more on another tense and challenging week for Alice Springs: What we’ve learned from the robodebt royal commission This week, the robodebt royal commissioner, Catherine Holmes, summed up the tenor of the evidence so far: “Everybody says it was really somebody else’s doing, and it’s a bit hard to get to the bottom of whose doing it was.” The hearings this fortnight focused primarily on the key period in late 2016 and early 2017 when the robodebt scheme exploded into public controversy. Here are some of the key things we learned over the past two weeks: For a couple of days this week, Dominic Perrottet was riding high. The ClubsNSW boss, Josh Landis, whose campaign against the premier’s proposed cashless gaming scheme was fuelling division within the coalition, was sacked, creating some clear air for Perrottet amid a volatile state election campaign. That relative peace for the coalition didn’t last long. By Thursday Perrottet was facing questions about the actions of the office of the former deputy premier John Barilaro. Despite being out of politics for more than a year, Barilaro is suddenly a focal point in the election campaign.

Ahead of its Early Years Summit to be held on 17 February, the government is seeking input as it hopes to “break down silos and create an integrated, whole-of-Commonwealth approach” to ensure children aged five and below have the “tools and supports to thrive no matter where they are born or raised”. Minister for social services Amanda Rishworth said: “We want to hear from a diverse range of voices in the community, including parents, families, carers and caregivers, educators, child and maternal healthcare providers, social workers, early years experts and anyone who wants to contribute to improving the lives of Australian children. Getting it right in the early years’ means not only that children and their families are supported to thrive in these critical years of development but also that any investments we make now can have broader, sustained benefits for our society and economy across current and future generations.” Minister for early childhood education Dr Anne Aly said “our children are our most precious resource, investing in them now is an investment in our future”. She added: “We know that 90 per cent of brain development happens in the first five years, which is why it’s so important we have a holistic approach to the early years.” Visit the department of social services website to access the discussion paper to make a submission and for other opportunities to contribute to the strategy. Submissions are open until 30 April. Sydney renter hit by 35% hike as housing crisis sparks calls to cap increases Millie Bannister was already anxious about how much the rental market had skyrocketed in Sydney when she received a letter from her landlord saying they wanted to increase her rent by 35%. “Last time, it only increased by $60, but now it’s going to increase by $270 a week, which is a 35% increase, and around $12,000 per year. For me and my roommate, two people in their mid-20s, it is not [easy] to wrangle with.” The 26-year-old heads up the mental health charity Allknd, and says the rent increase will change her life and her aspirations, amid calls for the state government to consider regulating rent caps. More on the surging rental crisis in Sydney, where renters have faced an 11% increase in the past year: Bushfire emergency warning in southwest WA A bushfire emergency warning has been issued for communities in the shire of Nannup in Western Australia’s southwest, with residents told “to act immediately to survive”. The Parks and Wildlife Service warning is in place for people in areas bounded by Cundinup-Kirup Road and Cundinup-Dudinyillup Road in the Maidment locality and Dudinyillup. “If the way is clear, leave now for a safer place. Do not wait and see, leaving at the last minute is deadly,” the warning said. “You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes.” People have been advised to shelter in their homes if they cannot leave the area safely. The fire was fast moving and uncontained and there had been multiple ignitions. Watch and act alerts are also in place for surrounding districts in the Nannup shire. Around 50 firefighters are battling the blaze and strengthening containment lines. The emergency warning has been issued as extreme or high fire danger ratings are in place for multiple weather districts across WA. -AAP Court ruling paves way for shakeup of decentralised finance Self-proclaimed bitcoin creator Craig Wright’s lawsuit against bitcoin network developers to try to recover billions of dollars can continue to trial, a London court says. The ruling paves the way for a trial on whether developers owe duties to the owners of digital assets - which a lawyer representing some developers said could pose a fundamental challenge to decentralised finance if Wright won. Australian computer scientist Wright is suing 15 developers in an effort to retrieve about 111,000 bitcoin - currently worth about $US2.5 billion ($A3.6 billion) - after he lost the encrypted keys to access them when his home computer network was allegedly hacked. Wright’s Seychelles-based company Tulip Trading is taking legal action against the developers of three networks, arguing they are obliged to write software patches to help Tulip recover the bitcoin. Tulip’s case was thrown out last year but the court of appeal ruled on Friday that developers arguably do owe duties to owners, which should be determined at a full trial. Judge Colin Birss said Tulip had a realistic argument that cryptocurrency is “entrusted” to network developers, who could therefore have a duty to, for example, “introduce code so that an owner’s bitcoin can be transferred to safety”. Wright says he wrote the bitcoin white paper which first outlined the technology behind the digital assets under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, however the claim is hotly disputed. He said in a statement that he was delighted with the ruling. James Ramsden, a lawyer who represented 13 of the 14 developers involved in the appeal, told Reuters that code writers are “incredibly nervous” about the case, which could leave them liable for massive sums of money if Wright wins. -AAP The medical community is reacting to a major government report into Medicare funding, which has put forward suggestions to update the system for Australia’s healthcare needs in 2023. The proposals include different specialists working better together, allowing pharmacists and nurses to do more tasks and take pressure off GPs, and changes to how the government pays for doctor’s visits. The head of the Australian Medical Association, the peak body representing doctors, said the report had nothing in it to help Australians immediately access more affordable and timely health care. While opposition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston said while the report pointed out the flaws with the system, it failed to provide specific actions or timelines for improvement. “The government needs to stop talking about the challenges facing Australians and start doing something about them,” she said. “Actions speak louder than words and what we have here is just more words and still no actions.” We’ll be bringing you more updates and reactions to that news throughout the day.

With a net asset value of $18bn (£14.9bn) in its last public statement, the Singapore-based hedge fund was known for taking large, highly leveraged stakes in crypto businesses and cryptocurrencies directly. It holds positions in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, as well as equity investments in companies such as the BlockFi exchange and options trading platform Deribit. The turmoil in the crypto markets has substantially reduced the value of those holdingsand wiped out some other stakes the fund, known as 3AC, has taken, including in doomed “algorithmic stablecoin” project Terra and “play-to-earn” game Axie Infinity, which was the victim of a $700m hack late last year, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Zhu Su, the Dubai-based investor behind the crypto-focused trading house, tweeted on Wednesday morning that “we are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out”. With traders already nursing wounds after a 25% drop in the price of bitcoin in a single day, sparked by the announcement by ersatz crypto bank Celsius that it would be suspending withdrawals, Zhu’s statement kicked off a further day of turmoil in the crypto sector. Crypto exchange Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, described the situation as a “bloodbath”. Bitcoin’s value continued to tumble on Wednesday, to just over $20,000, 70% below its record high of $69,000 in November. Tether, the centralised stablecoin which holds systemic importance to the wider cryptocurrency sector, published a statement denying any losses from 3AC or Celsius. “Celsius position has been liquidated with no losses to Tether,” the company said. “Tether’s lending activity with Celsius (as with any other borrower) has always been overcollateralized. Tether has currently zero exposure to Celsius apart from a small investment made out of Tether equity in the company.” The company had previously told the Financial Times that its loans to Celsius were 30% over-collateralised, meaning it had taken $1.30 in bitcoin for every $1 it lent out. Tether added: “Tether is aware of other rumours being spread, suggesting that it has lending exposure to Three Arrows Capital – again this is categorically false.” The company also dismissed claims that its large holdings of commercial paper – short-term loans to businesses – were held in disproportionately risky investments. It also said that it intended to replace those holdings with US Treasury bonds, though offered no date by which that switch was intended to have occurred. On Wednesday, the Tron DAO reserve project, which backs the USDD algorithmic stablecoin, announced it was withdrawing more than $100m worth of cryptocurrency from Binance in order to support the dollar peg of its stablecoin, which had slipped to $0.97 on crypto exchanges. That sparked fears that the stablecoin might follow in the footsteps of its similarly structured peer UST, the collapse of which precipitated the latest crisis. Teunis Brosens, head economist for digital finance at Dutch bank ING, said that while the run on cryptocurrencies could partly be explained by wider market conditions, the recent collapse of the Terra stablecoin project had sparked a deeper concern about the overall viability of some of the less well-known digital assets. “Crypto investors have grown very critical, especially about the more complex products, and want to get out. There may still be confidence in bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the more straightforward currencies, but as people scramble to get out of the complex products, entities like Celsius have to liquidate their conventional coins like bitcoin and Ethereum, which only depresses their price further.” On Tuesday evening, Bill Gates warned that the Crypto sector was a bubble economy, “100% based on greater fool theory”, the idea that profit comes from finding someone dumber than you to sell your asset to. “I’m used to asset classes … like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products,” Gates said.","publicationTime":1655300411.000000000,"title":"Cryptocurrency ‘bloodbath’ threatens multibillion-dollar hedge fund","id":"technology/2022/jun/15/cryptocurrency-multibillion-dollar-hedge-fund-bitcoin-drop"},{"body":"When bitcoin mining company Bit Digital started shipping its energy-intensive computers out of China in early 2021, eyebrows were raised. “A lot of people thought we were being overly paranoid,” says chief strategy officer Samir Tabar, who helped relocate all of the company’s machines to the US and Canada. But the company’s paranoia paid off. China’s bitcoin mining ban last summer, driven partly by environmental concerns, sent the industry spinning into chaos. The announcement sparked a fire sale of the computers used to power bitcoin, with mining companies scrambling to ship more than 2m of the machines out of China. They arrived by the crateload in countries like the US, Russia and Kazakhstan. China was home to about 65% of global bitcoin production in 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. Although the country banned bitcoin mining for a number of reasons, one was the massive energy consumption bitcoin required and the impediment that posed to China’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. Chinese regulators aren’t the only ones concerned by bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index estimates that bitcoin mining consumes 133.63 terawatt hours a year of electricity – more than the entire countries of Ukraine and Norway. This figure keeps growing: bitcoin mining currently uses 66 times more electricity than in 2015. Bitcoiners like to say that China’s ban proved the resilience of the network. Although the “hashrate” – a measure of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin – plummeted around the time of the crackdown, it had recovered by the end of the year. But bitcoin’s energy consumption now poses an existential threat to the mining industry, with a growing number of lawmakers around the world eager to follow China’s lead. Kazakhstan initially welcomed China’s stranded bitcoin miners as a potential boon to the economy. Lured by the promise of lax regulation and cheap coal power, an estimated fifth of global bitcoin mining production migrated there. But bitcoin’s rapacious energy demand created intense pressure on Kazakhstan’s ageing energy grid this winter. The threat of emergency blackouts soon led the government to permit grid operators to limit power supply to miners, leaving some facilities without power. Even in renewable energy havens, the future of bitcoin mining is far from assured. Iceland, which gets almost all of its energy from renewables, won’t welcome any more bitcoin miners to its shores. Regulators in Sweden say that bitcoin mining siphons energy from more productive industries, and are currently lobbying the EU to ban the practice outright. Norway-based bitcoin miner Arcane’s CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen dismisses this as a “very planned-economy approach”. But even in the free-market-loving US, an increasing number of lawmakers are souring on the industry. In theory, a greener bitcoin is possible. The digital coin’s energy consumption is tied to its underlying “proof-of-work” protocol (PoW). This is the decentralised consensus mechanism that secures the currency and prevents fraud or hacking, in the absence of oversight from banks or another centralised body. The role of bitcoin miners is essentially to verify transactions on the blockchain. Think of bitcoin mining as a contest where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The “winner” adds the next block of transactions to the distributed ledger (ie, the blockchain) and claims payment in the form of new bitcoins and a transaction fee. The miner using the most computing power is likely to solve the problem fastest, creating the incentive to expend more energy in order to “win”. This ballooning energy consumption is fuelling the popularity of a less energy-intensive alternative: proof-of-stake (PoS). Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain platform that allows users to create smart contracts, says that a friend of hers ran a cryptography mailing list when bitcoin was first announced. “Arguably the first bitcoin sceptic”, his first reaction was, “‘If this is successful, it’s going to absorb all the energy in the universe, and it’s going to be terrible.’” Tezos is built on PoS instead, which uses a consensus mechanism different from bitcoin’s. Rather than “miners” competing with computing power, different nodes of the distributed network compete by committing “stakes” of tokens. Staking a greater number of tokens – which risk being forfeited in the event of fraud – increases the likelihood that a node will be selected by an algorithm to produce the next block of transactions, receiving rewards in the form of more tokens. Because it’s the “stake” (ie, the number of tokens) rather than “work” (ie, energy expenditure) that secures the network, PoS reduces network power demand by more than 99% relative to PoW. Instead of warehouses stacked high with purpose-built machines, PoS can run on a dinky Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Although Breitman says environmental concerns aren’t what pushed her blockchain to pick PoS, it’s becoming more advantageous as scrutiny on PoW ramps up. Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain after bitcoin, is planning to shift to PoS by the end of 2022, and a number of new blockchain applications such as Cardano and Polkadot have chosen to launch using this protocol. The European Commission is among the regulatory bodies trying to incentivise the industry to migrate applications from PoW to PoS but the bitcoin network has so far resisted any such move. It’s not that bitcoiners don’t care about the environmental impact – although a vocal minority on social media might give this impression, says digital assets lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), Michel Rauchs. The issue is that a majority of bitcoiners remain adamant that PoS is not a worthy replacement for PoW. Many bitcoiners believe that PoS subverts the fundamental principles of a decentralised currency that must remain outside the reach of governments and the banking system. “The problem with proof-of-stake is that it’s not trustless and it’s not censorship-resistant, and it’s not objective,” says Chris Bendiksen, research lead at digital assets investment company CoinShares. “There’s no real difference from a high-level perspective between proof-of-stake and consensus shareholder capitalism… Proof-of-stake is not a replacement for proof-of-work, it’s just a return to the pre-bitcoin system.” Some bitcoiners claim that the environmental debate is overblown because energy usage will fall over the coming years. This is because the profit miners receive for minting new coins is programmed to halve roughly every four years. Eventually, all bitcoins will be mined and miners will only receive transaction fees. “Since the [payment in the form of new coins] will go away and transaction fees won’t go up, electricity consumption will end up being much lower than the doomsayers believe,” says Pierre Rochard, a longtime bitcoin investor and developer. In other words, shrinking rewards should shrink the pool of competing miners. Whether or not this will be the case, reluctance to rewire bitcoin’s underlying protocol tosses the ball back into the bitcoin miners’ court to tackle the issue of energy consumption. They’re rising to the challenge – at least in rhetoric. Bitcoin mining is the cleanest and most efficient use of energy in the world out of any major industry, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), said in a recent briefing. “The only way you get more sustainable and more efficient would be to create an imaginary industry.” (More imaginary than bitcoin, that is.) The BMC is a body of bitcoin miners set up last year to address growing concerns over the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption. Its purpose is to promote sustainability within the industry, but it’s also part of the fightback against bitcoin’s image problem. The headline figure promoted at the meeting was that bitcoin accounts for only 0.1% of the Earth’s total energy consumption – which sounds a lot smaller than the frequent comparisons to small countries. (The 0.1% figure caught on fast among bitcoin miners – several quoted it to the Observer.) Rauchs said that the 0.1% figure sounded “roughly in line” with CCAF’s data. What’s more, 58% of the energy used to power the industry is sustainable according to the BMC. A report from CCAF in 2020 estimated this figure at a more conservative 39%, but Rauchs stresses this was only a snapshot of energy consumption at that moment in time, and couldn’t comment on the reliability of the BMC’s estimate without seeing the underlying data. Some bitcoiners argue that the cryptocurrency could incentivise a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Because bitcoin mining operations don’t have to be switched on all the time, they pair well with the intermittent nature of renewable energy according to the argument, and can compel energy companies to increase renewable energy capacity, as well as helping to balance the grid. Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings, which runs operations in Nebraska, Texas and South Dakota, claims to have such agreements with power providers. “The company that generates the electricity can tell us to shut down our mining rigs,” says its CEO Fred Thiel, meaning “they’ll all of a sudden have 100-200 megawatts – whatever amount we’re consuming – available to put into the grid at a moment’s notice. We act like a big battery.” There isn’t evidence that this is happening at scale yet, says Rauchs, although it could become more important in future. However, bitcoin mining is not particularly unique in this regard, says Arvind Ravikumar, a petroleum researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. Electric vehicle charging and so-called “tier zero” data centres that don’t support critical functions are also suited to these “demand response” arrangements that can be paired with renewable energy on the grid, he says. “The idea that you have to create a new demand, like bitcoin mining, is not correct.” And the flipside is where growing energy demands incentivise defunct fossil fuel-powered stations to come back online. Controversially, bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation Holdings reopened a former coal power plant in Dresden, New York, and converted it to natural gas, causing the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions to increase almost tenfold between 2019 and 2020. Discussions about Bitcoin’s energy consumption tend to wind up in a philosophical cul-de-sac about the inherent utility of the industry. Critics contend that this utility is zero, which can provoke defensiveness in its advocates. “There are old-school bitcoiners who are like, ‘Who cares about the energy consumption? Bitcoin deserves to exist,’” says Breitman. “It becomes an argument about values.” Many allege that energy overuse is simply the latest stick with which to beat bitcoin, and that the industry is subject to unfair moral scrutiny compared to others – like gold mining or Wall Street day trading. Rauchs is “actually pretty sympathetic” to that argument, saying bitcoiners are correct that hyperbole about bitcoin destroying years of climate progress is “completely out of proportion”. Whichever way you slice it, eliminating bitcoin isn’t a fast-track solution to global heating. Ravikumar says the most important issue is what the industry is doing to reduce emissions. “That’s the question we need to be focusing on – rather than what, if any, are the benefits of Bitcoin mining.”","publicationTime":1643544020.000000000,"title":"How do we solve bitcoin’s carbon problem?","id":"technology/2022/jan/30/how-do-we-solve-bitcoins-carbon-problem"},{"body":"The founder of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, has apologised for his company’s near-collapse this week, saying he “fucked up” in his calculations and in his communications during the crisis. Sam Bankman-Fried, a billionaire and major donor to the US Democratic party who has lobbied Washington for tighter regulation of the crypto market, was speaking following a run on his Bahamas-headquartered FTX exchange. Customers withdrew $6bn (£5.15bn) in the 72 hours before Tuesday morning, Reuters reported, citing a message to staff at FTX, when the exchange was forced to block further redemptions in an effort to remain solvent. It has yet to restart withdrawals, is blocking new account signups and advising existing customers against depositing. The turmoil at FTX is tearing through the cryptocurrency market, with the cornerstone digital asset, bitcoin, falling 7.6% over 24 hours to $16,775 and the second largest, ethereum, falling 4.4% to $1,205. Investors pulled $700m from Tether, the “stablecoin” that underpins much of the sector’s economy. “I’m sorry. That’s the biggest thing,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a series of tweets. “The full story here is one I’m still fleshing out every detail of, but as a very high level, I fucked up twice.” Due to “poor internal labelling of bank-related accounts”, he said he “was substantially off” in his calculations of the sums the exchange had lent out to users to let them make leveraged bets – borrowing money to trade with, magnifying potential gains and losses. That meant that he thought the company had enough money on hand to pay out 24 times the normal daily withdrawals – but in fact, it did not have enough to even pay out all the withdrawals on Sunday alone. “We saw roughly $5bn of withdrawals on Sunday – the largest by a huge margin.” But, he insisted, while the exchange was suffering a liquidity crunch, it was not insolvent, and still held more assets than the total value of all the customer deposits – albeit in a form that could not be easily converted to cash. Bankman-Fried’s belated defence came hours after one FTX’s largest external investors had declared the company worthless. In a note to partners, the venture capital firm Sequoia said it had written down its $150m investment to nothing. “In recent days, a liquidity crunch has created a solvency risk for FTX. The full nature and extent of this risk is not known at this time. Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,” the investors wrote, in a message signed Team Sequoia. Just two months earlier, the firm had published a long self-congratulatory story about how its partners had invested in the company because Bankman-Fried was “obviously a genius” who had a vision to turn FTX into a super-app where you could buy everything from a bitcoin to a banana. Other investors have lost similar sums, including the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which last year invested about $400m in the exchange, valuing FTX at $25bn. The sudden collapse in value was prompted by leaked documents which implied that Alameda Research, a hedge fund tightly intertwined with FTX through its common owner, Bankman-Fried, was in effect insolvent. Alameda’s accounts rested on a token, FTT, that was issued by FTX and had no value other than that guaranteed by the exchange, according to the documents. In his latest statement, Bankman-Fried did not address the root cause of the bank run, other than to say that Alameda “aren’t doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter – and nothing large at all”. He added: “One way or another, Alameda Research is winding down trading.” The leaks about Alameda turned into a crisis for FTX when Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced it would sell its own major stake in FTT. The fire sale that followed crashed the value of the token far below the $22 floor that FTX had committed to support, and prompted the equivalent of a bank run at FTX itself, as customers raced to withdraw their deposits faster than the exchange could process them. The fight between the two exchanges briefly turned into an alliance, as Binance agreed to make a non-binding offer to bail FTX out and merge with it. But on Wednesday night, the deal fell through. “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.com,” Binance said.","publicationTime":1668079719.000000000,"title":"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX now worthless, says key investor","id":"technology/2022/nov/10/cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-now-worthless-says-key-investor"},{"body":"In the middle of rural Texas, a cryptocurrency mine is currently under construction. Hundreds of machines more powerful than the average computer will soon be housed in this 320-acre mining facility in Dickens county, where they will work day and night to solve a complex series of algorithms. If successful, the reward will be newly minted bitcoin, currently worth about $44,000 each. All the machines need to thrive are spaces to sit and electricity – lots of it. Kevin Brendle, Dickens county’s top elected official, embraced the idea of the mine when Argo Blockchain, a Canadian cryptocurrency mining company, first approached him with the idea of building a facility in the area. Dickens county, population 2,300, “is mostly improved pasture and grassland”, Brendle said. “It’s wide-open range land, it’s cattle country with a little farming,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of economic development.” A mine could help stimulate the economy, creating jobs and improving the county’s tax base. And in return, the mine will be powered by some of the cheapest electricity in the world. To be profitable, mining cryptocurrency requires lots of cheap energy. China was once the main hub for mining, with over half of the world’s mining taking place in the country, precisely because its electricity is cheap. But earlier this summer, local governments in China began to shut down bitcoin mines as the country works to develop its own, better-controlled digital currency. The bitcoin hashrate – the processing power used to produce bitcoin – halved after the crackdown. Miners have since been scouring the globe for places where electricity is cheap, and many have settled on Texas as their destination. Texas’s power grid is deregulated, which means customers can choose between different power providers and providers are thus incentivized to provide low rates. Mining facilities can set up long-term contracts with power providers that allows them to purchase electricity at a fixed price for many years, says Jason Les, CEO of Riot Blockchain, a US-based cryptocurrency mining company. Riot Blockchain recently acquired Whinstone US, the largest bitcoin mining facility in the US based in Rockdale, Texas, for $80m. Whinstone says its facility can produce 500 bitcoin per month – worth a total of $22m at bitcoin’s current value. When demand for electricity goes up, particularly in the summer months, Texas power companies will actually pay mining facilities to lower their energy usage. “If you were a miner that has a long-term power purchase agreement, then you own power at a fixed price … you’re committing to buying energy for years no matter what,” Les said. “As a bitcoin miner, you essentially own that power, and that allows you to work like a virtual power plant. You can take the power that you agreed to buy at a fixed lower price, and then you can sell that back to the grid.” In recent months, Texas leaders have been vocal about their support of cryptocurrency mining coming to their state. In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a bill that puts cryptocurrency under commercial law, making it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to operate in the state. In the same month, Abbott, tweeted: “Texas will be the cryptocurrency leader!” after the Texas grocery chain H-E-B announced that it will be putting cryptocurrency kiosks in some of its stores. Also making the state attractive to miners is that 20% of its energy comes from wind power, making mining in Texas a much greener alternative than mining in China, where about two-thirds of electricity comes from coal. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, halted his company’s acceptance of bitcoin transactions, citing the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Musk said that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin once there’s confirmation that about half of the energy used by miners will be from clean energy. While states like Kentucky and Louisiana also have cheap power, and others like Wyoming – which recently made it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to become LLCs – have politicians that are cryptocurrency-friendly, Texas is the only state that seems to offer miners the best of both worlds. “We’ve seen a good combination of political will with the reality of the electricity market there that have led people to start building in Texas,” said Josh Goodbody, chief operating office of Qredo, a digital asset management company. “Increasingly, people are looking at Texas as a friendly place to build crypto businesses.” Along with the Argo and Whinstone facilities, BIT Mining, a Chinese mining company, has invested $25m to build a mine in Texas. An influx of interest from cryptocurrency businesses does not come without risk, though. Bitmain, a China-based company, said in 2018 that it would invest $500m to build a huge mining facility in Rockdale, bringing jobs to a community that has seen huge job losses after a coal plant closure in 2008. But after the price of bitcoin dropped to just over $3,000 in the fall, the company pulled out of the project. Brendle, of Dickens, said that his optimism is cautious. He has hope that cryptocurrency mining will be able to bolster his county’s economy and give stable jobs to some of his residents, but he notes that long-term sustainability is important. “We see movement now, we see a lot of interest. We understand why that interest is there. But we just don’t know what the future of bitcoin mining is,” Brendle said. “I think that’s the biggest concern right now is how long, how well the industry will sustain itself.”","publicationTime":1629190802.000000000,"title":"Why bitcoin entrepreneurs are flocking to rural Texas","id":"technology/2021/aug/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mining-texas"},{"body":"The price of bitcoin fell by almost 30% on Wednesday, after a Chinese government crackdown on banks’ use of cryptocurrencies accelerated a long-predicted sell-off, in a day of chaotic trading. The world’s largest digital currency tumbled to about $30,000 (£21,000) amid frenzied trading, a drop of more than 50% since it hit record highs of more than $64,000 in mid-April. However, by 10pm UK time, the bitcoin price had risen back to about $38,500, still down 11% on the day, according to Refinitiv data. Critics have been predicting a sell-off for months, claiming the coin has no intrinsic value. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has even warned that investors should be prepared to lose all their money if they dabble in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has compared bitcoin’s meteoric rise to other financial bubbles such as “tulip mania” and the South Sea bubble, which eventually burst in the 17th and 18th centuries. The cryptocurrency has come under pressure this week following a string of tweets from Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, who investors fear has U-turned in his support for the decentralised coins. But the latest blow came from China, where the financial industry regulators said banks and payment firms were not allowed to offer clients any services involving cryptocurrencies, and warned of the risks linked to trading crypto assets. While the country already has crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings, consumers are still allowed to own crypto assets. “Recently, cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and plummeted, and speculative trading of cryptocurrency has rebounded, seriously infringing on the safety of people’s property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order,” the regulator’s statement, issued on Wednesday, said. The news accelerated a sell-off that started last week after Musk, seen as a staunch backer of cryptocurrencies, suspended plans to let Tesla customers pay for cars in bitcoin due to environmental concerns about the energy required to mine them, which contradicted the ethos of the electric car market. Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at stockbroker AJ Bell, said the environmental concerns and regulatory risks meant the “tide has turned on bitcoin” and “raised doubt over the long term adoption of cryptocurrency by businesses and consumers”. But, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, who has invested in several crypto-related companies, said that Ark still held a $500,000 price target on Bitcoin. “We go through soul-searching times like this and scrape the models and, yes, our conviction is just as high,” she told Bloomberg TV. “I think we’re in a capitulation phase. That’s a really great time to buy, no matter what the asset is.” Earlier this week Musk was also forced to clarify that Tesla had not sold off any bitcoin, following a confusing exchange on Twitter over the weekend about plans for Tesla’s bitcoin holdings. After bitcoin’s slump, Musk tweeted that Tesla has “diamond hands” – internet slang for holding on to a position despite wild price swings. Musk’s ability to shift prices with a single tweet has given further ammunition to critics who say cryptocurrencies are too volatile. Saxo Bank’s chief investment officer, Steen Jakobsen, said the latest sell-off seemed to be “deeper” than previous episodes, and was hitting other cryptocurrencies such as Ether, which plunged 40% during the selloff. It fell from about $3,400 to below $2,000, before later recovering to about $2,850, down 16% on the day, according to Coinbase data. One-time parody cryptocurrency Dogecoin – based on an internet meme of a shiba inu dog – also tumbled more than 40%, before paring some of its losses on Wednesday afternoon to trade roughly 15% lower at $0.40. Dogecoin has failed to recover after Musk described the virtual currency as a “hustle” during his appearance on US comedy sketch show, Saturday Night Live earlier this month. “A new widespread deleveraging has sloshed through the cryptocurrency market,” Jakobsen said. “There is a major bleed across the entire crypto space today,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said, noting that investors might be rightly worried that other countries could follow China’s lead. “China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification – other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies,” Wilson said. “Until now western regulators have been pretty relaxed about bitcoin, but this might change soon,” he added. Shares of Tesla Inc fell 2.5% on Wednesday, underperforming the wider market, as China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies weighed on the electric car maker. Tesla disclosed in early February it had bought around $1.5 billion of bitcoin, and later sold around 10% for a $101m profit.","publicationTime":1621492852.000000000,"title":"Bitcoin plunges after China crackdown","id":"technology/2021/may/19/bitcoin-falls-30-after-china-crackdown"},{"body":"A second cabinet minister has said they fell victim to hackers and was forced to apologise after their Twitter account posted a series of offensive tweets about race, sexuality and gender identity. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said others temporarily gained access to his account and posted some “deeply unpleasant stuff”. The tweets were deleted swiftly, and his team said they were in contact with Twitter to resolve the issue. One of the posts on Heaton-Harris’s account read: “Why are black people so poor?” Another, captured by social media users, appeared to say: “We are passing a new law soon, all transgenders and homosexuals will now serve 10 years behind bars.” Heaton-Harris sent a message to his 33,000 followers shortly afterwards. He said: “I’m afraid my Twitter account was hacked overnight and someone posted some deeply unpleasant stuff on my account for which I can only apologise.” The hack of his account will cause concern among government security officials. It follows another cabinet minister, the education secretary Gillian Keegan, also having her Twitter account hacked over Christmas. Her account was compromised for several days, and spewed out a series of tweets promoting cryptocurrencies. Keegan’s account responded to several other users’ tweets with links to a website advertising bitcoin and dogecoin. Several days later, all references to Keegan in her Twitter name, biography, photograph and banner had been removed. Issues with tech security among MPs has become a salient issue over the past few months. In November, the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to boost security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, update software and delete old messages. The warning came after Liz Truss’s phone was reportedly hacked by Russians in the summer when she was foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Conservative party leadership race. Hoyle’s letter to MPs, which included 10 security tips, said: “You may not feel able to do everything on this list, but the more you do the less likely your personal information and mobile phone will be compromised, or the less damaging the consequences if you are hacked.” In July, the British army’s Twitter and YouTube accounts also were reportedly hacked, with posts promoting NFTs – non-fungible tokens or digital artworks – and a purported interview with Musk about cryptocurrency. Elon Musk, the under-fire owner of Twitter, has been vocal previously about his commitment to stamping out false and spam users on the social media platform.","publicationTime":1672916042.000000000,"title":"Second cabinet minister says Twitter account hacked","id":"politics/2023/jan/05/second-cabinet-minister-chris-heaton-harris-says-twitter-account-hacked"},{"body":"The Twitter account of the British education secretary appears to have been hacked. The profile picture was changed to one showing Elon Musk and several tweets were posted promoting a cryptocurrency event. On Christmas Day the account of Gillian Keegan, the MP for Chichester, replied to a number of tweets with links to a website advertising cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and dogecoin. On Sunday evening the account posted a spate of tweets, suggesting the security had been compromised. By Monday all reference to Keegan in her Twitter name, her biography, photograph and banner had been removed. In a tweet reply to YouTuber MrBeast, Keegan’s account posted: “Don’t let it get away! It’s gonna be awesome!” It was accompanied by a link purporting to advertise a “giveaway” for the “crypto community”. In a reply to a tweet by Musk, the new owner of Twitter, words on the account said: “Thank you for another great year! This feels a lot like Christmas. Don’t miss guys!! BREAKING NEWS 4 Christmas.” In other tweets the account described people who own the cryptocurrency dogecoin, once backed by Musk, as “a #dogecoin warrior fighting for the future!” The cryptocurrency, which launched as a joke in 2013, soared in value earlier this year after Musk promoted it by saying it could be used to buy Tesla merchandise. The tweets on Keegan’s account began appearing shortly before 7.30pm on Christmas Day, and were sent throughout the evening into the early hours on Boxing Day. Last month the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to ramp up security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, as well as update software and delete old messages.

With a camera click on the QR code, she receives her payment: four hundred-thousandths of a Bitcoin. Then, as the rain pelts the corrugated iron roof and a gust of wind lifts the blue plastic table cloths, the power cuts out. A tumultuous few weeks awaits El Salvador as it prepares to become the first country to adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular decentralised digital currency, as legal tender on 7 September. With that deadline looming, a host of challenges – technological, financial and criminal – threaten to sink the plan of the president, Nayib Bukele, to ride the Central American economy out of its current choppy waters on the back of a cryptocurrency wave. El Zonte, a surf town with about 3,000 residents and a black sand, pebble-strewn beach, is an unlikely location for a global financial revolution. But since 2018 the town’s Bitcoin Beach project has been a petri dish for cryptocurrency adoption. Backed by Californian donors, the project gave $50 (£36) in Bitcoin to each local family, encouraged the cryptocurrency’s adoption by local vendors, and paid dozens of social projects with it, from lifeguarding to rubbish collecting. “Now you can buy groceries, pupusas, or pay for your internet with Bitcoin,” says José Roman Martínez, 30, one of the founders of Bitcoin Beach. “For many people, this is the first time they’ve received a digital payment.” Interest in the project from crypto-savvy tourists has given a new lease of life to El Zonte and led to a real-estate boom in the town, according to Martínez. “When I was a kid, the only thing Salvadorans wanted to do was to cross the border and head to the US. Now the kids here are dreaming of better things.” Can a circular-economy experiment backed by a handful of foreign crypto-evangelists replicate itself at the national level? Salvadorans have had no say in the matter so far, but they are about to find out. Bukele announced his plan to elevate Bitcoin to legal tender in June (a month before his 40th birthday) with his customary millennial elan: via video link to a Miami cryptocurrency conference. Since then, like Elon Musk with a presidential mandate, he has prolifically pumped out Bitcoin memes and promises on his Twitter account. Just five days after the announcement, lawmakers passed the bill by a large majority. A national digital wallet called Chivo – local slang for “cool” – is in development with $30 worth of Bitcoin uploaded to each one as an initial balance. Transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from capital gains tax, and foreigners investing three Bitcoins in the country (about $120,000) will be granted residency. In August a research note by Bank of America enthused about the new law’s ability to reduce the cost of cross-border transactions (remittances account for 20% of El Salvador’s GDP), increase digital penetration in a country where 70% of people still do not use banks, and attract foreign investment as a first mover in cryptocurrency adoption. Since then, however, the verdict from international financial organisations – and El Salvadorans themselves – has turned decidedly pessimistic. “The law was adopted extremely quickly, without a technical study or a public debate,” says Ricardo Castaneda, a local economist. “I don’t think the president has fully understood the implications of the law, its potential to cause serious macroeconomic problems and convert the country into a haven for money laundering.” The regulatory framework for adoption has yet to be published and there are rumours of delays to the Chivo app. Bankers in the capital say they have received calls from anxious clients threatening to withdraw their deposits rather than risk exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency markets. The ratings agency Moody’s downgraded El Salvadoran debt over fears of “weakened governance” evidenced by the new law, and the IMF – with which the government is negotiating a $1bn loan – published a blogpost highlighting the risks of adopting crypto as national currency. “The shift from euphoria to scepticism has been very fast,” says Castaneda. The potential benefits identified by the Bank of America are probably overstated. A paper by Johns Hopkins University says the cost of remittances via Bitcoin will be higher than traditional methods, and a July survey found that nearly two-thirds of El Salvadorans would not be open to accepting payment in Bitcoin. Eric Grill, CEO of Chainbytes, which produces Bitcoin ATMs, told the Guardian that his plan to relocate manufacturing to El Salvador had faced serious challenges in sourcing parts. Local geothermal energy experts say Bukele’s plan to power energy-intensive Bitcoin mining activities from the country’s volcanoes are wildly optimistic. The government insists that El Salvadorans will be free to exchange their Bitcoin for US dollars, which the country adopted as national currency in 2001, and has proposed a $150m fund to ensure convertibility. Given popular scepticism, however, critics say this is unlikely to be sufficient. It would also open the door for illegal actors to convert Bitcoin – which rose to prominence on Silk Road, an online black market, and prides itself on the anonymity of transactions – to dollars via a national bank and thereby launder their gains. Perhaps the biggest concern, however, is that it exposes a population with little financial education – for the most part, without an economic safety net – to the fate of the highly volatile cryptocurrency markets. “The Bitcoin law essentially gambles with two public purses, that of the El Salvador government and of the IMF,” says Daniel Munevar, a Colombian economist focused on debt justice. “It’s one thing for an American to bet his stimulus cheque on cryptocurrency in the hope of big returns, but this is Yolo [you only live once] investing elevated to the national level.” In El Zonte, locals are developing their own common-sense investment strategies. Dominga Peña sells minutas – cups of shaved ice flavoured with fruit syrups – on the beach. She says one in 10 customers pay with Bitcoin and she keeps most of that as an emergency spending fund for small purchases. “The people from Bitcoin Beach explained the benefits and disadvantages [of receiving crypto-payments],” she said. “It changed my mentality to investing, but I wouldn’t keep too much money in Bitcoin. The price has gone up and down a lot recently.”","publicationTime":1630297825.000000000,"title":"Scepticism grows in El Salvador over pioneering Bitcoin gamble","id":"world/2021/aug/30/scepticism-grows-in-el-salvador-over-pioneering-bitcoin-gamble"},{"body":"More than 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams aimed at consumers via social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok have been identified and targeted by the financial watchdog during the past year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the use of social media marketing channels and the rise of so-called “fin-fluencers” – particularly directing investment products at younger age groups – exploded last year, resulting in a record number of takedown notices and alerts. The FCA ordered businesses to amend or remove 8,582 promotions during 2022, 15 times the 573 recorded the previous year. It also published almost 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up more than a third up on 2021. Google, which owns YouTube, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Microsoft’s Bing have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products after FCA intervention. However, the regulator said it was still monitoring whether the companies were effectively blocking illegal adverts. “More needs to be done by tech companies to protect consumers,” the FCA said. “Given the substantial number of illegal promotions we continue to identify, our expectation is that every social media platform improves their capability to identify and remove the illegal financial promotions on a proactive basis.” The crackdown included taking action against a company that attempted to take advantage of the cost of living crisis, targeting more than 70,000 online followers that the FCA deemed were potentially vulnerable consumers. An online retail broker with more than 1.1 million UK customers, with a primary market of millennial age investors, was ordered to halt a marketing campaign after the FCA identified “serious concerns” that its promotions, which used social media influencers, were “targeting vulnerable customers with significant debt”. The FCA also sought to get an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange offering products to UK consumers to be shut down, and separately alerted 55 consumers who had been identified on a scammers list targeting consumers who had been searching for loans online. “Financial promotions must be fair, clear and not misleading,” said Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets, at the FCA. “This year, we will continue to put pressure on people using social media to illegally promote investments, which put people’s hard-earned money at risk.” The FCA said advances in the technology it uses to identify problem firms and misleading adverts had also fuelled the increase in cases last year. It has hired more than 100 people in roles such as machine learning and data analysis to build automated tools to scan thousands of websites every day. The watchdog said it looked at about 180,000 websites last year, resulting in about 4,500 websites and social media platforms being reviewed. This resulted in 1,441 alerts being issued and 400 of the offending websites being taken down. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors. The watchdog slapped bans on a bitcoin firm for urging that it was “time to buy” or miss out, and on football club Arsenal’s campaign to get fans to buy its crypto “tokens”.","publicationTime":1675446951.000000000,"title":"Scams: FCA blocks more than 10,000 ads from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube","id":"money/2023/feb/03/scams-fca-blocks-more-than-10000-ads-from-instagram-facebook-and-youtube"},{"body":"Changpeng Zhao does not like ambiguous words. Which is just as well: the crypto industry, in which he is a leading figure, is in turmoil and crying out for clarity. The 45-year-old founder and chief executive of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, meets the Observer in an upmarket London hotel after one of the most tumultuous weeks in the short history of digital money. Binance was forced to suspend its bitcoin business on 13 June for a few hours. On the same day, a major crypto lender, Celsius, also paused withdrawals. Then a big crypto hedge fund admitted it was in trouble. Finally, last Saturday, in a symbolic moment, bitcoin fell below $20,000. The cornerstone of crypto has lost more than half its value this year, leaving both professional and amateur investors nursing steep losses. Often referred to by the nickname CZ (see-zee), Zhao is dressed in the classic tech-tycoon mix of formal dark suit with a company T-shirt and trainers. He says he is travelling from country to country at the moment, meeting with “different government officials, regulators”. Despite his softly spoken manner, he is on a mission to convince. The conversation gets hooked on semantics at times – perhaps a response to the level of scrutiny he and his business are under. Asked if he still considers the recent crypto market moves to be “normal”, as he described them this month, Zhao says: “Normal depends on how you look at it … everybody has a different definition of normal … fluctuations in price is normal.” There is a similar focus on meaning when Zhao is asked about money laundering – “the word is very different in different countries” – although he says Binance can “for sure” do a “good enough job that the regulators are happy”. Last June, the Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activities in Britain, saying it was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. Zhao has not given up, however, and says he is seeking a licence to operate. Last week, Bloomberg ran an interview with him that raised the prospect of a deep regulatory winter for his business. He responded by tweeting to his 6.5 million followers: “I will stop doing interviews with news outlets that do clickbait titles.” He clearly has a deep interest in media. Binance has announced plans for a $200m (£160m) investment in Forbes, the business publisher, as well as investing $500m in Elon Musk’s $44bn bid for Twitter. Born in the coastal province of Jiangsu, north of Shanghai, Zhao followed his academic father to Canada when he was 12. After graduating from Montreal’s McGill University with a degree in computer science he worked on programming systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg. Zhao then moved to Shanghai in 2005, where he founded a high-frequency trading platform. It was there that he was drawn into a conversation about bitcoin during a poker game in 2013. Binance was founded four years later. *** CV Age 45 Family “I like to keep that private for security and privacy reasons.” Education McGill University, Canada. Last holiday Takes one- or two- day vacations a few times a year, but not long vacations. Best advice he’s been given “Internally, keep your head down and build. Externally, learn risk management. If everything went to zero, are you still OK?” Biggest career mistake Should have started Binance sooner. Words he overuses “Who is responsible for this? Who?” How he relaxes Books, hanging out with friends. *** The impact of recent events on Zhao’s fortune has been precipitous, according to one source. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that his wealth – based on a 90% stake in Binance and his control of its related US exchange – has fallen by more than $75bn since January to $20.6bn, as the wider market has more than halved over the same period to about $900bn. Zhao laughs that off. “I actually have no idea how they come up with those numbers. You need to understand that net worth are just estimates,” he says. “When I look at my wallet, I don’t have that much. I don’t have anywhere close to any of those numbers.” If you are wondering how Zhao could find $20bn in his wallet anyway, he is referring to his crypto wallet – the encrypted account on a blockchain where digital money is stored. Although all blockchain activity is technically public, most large investors try to keep their wallets pseudonymous, and Zhao’s has not been publicly identified. Binance makes money by connecting buyers with sellers, for a fee. It provides an exchange for a range of currencies, from bitcoin to dogecoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The company also offers to store those assets in a crypto wallet, and there is a range of financial products, including derivatives. It has 120 million customers globally and processes $1tn worth of trades a month, with Italy and France among the countries it is allowed to operate in, although customers can access it through the unregulated, offshore binance.com platform. Last year, Zhao told the AP news agency that he only held bitcoin and his firm’s own crypto-asset, BNB. One issue puzzling regulators is the lack of clarity about Binance’s structure. The holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands but the company describes itself as having “decentralised” ownership, with its terms and conditions referring to an “ecosystem”. For instance, its US exchange is separate from the main binance.com platform, whose operating base is not disclosed. Some of the other questions over Binance are more serious. Reuters published a report in June that alleged it had served as a conduit for the laundering of at least $2.35bn in illicit funds from hacks, investment frauds and illegal drug sales. Zhao says he disputes the claims “very heavily”, adding the public record afforded by blockchains should have enabled Binance to trace the transactions. “We ask for a list of transactions, not just a list of names. They provided zero.” Reuters said: “We stand by our reporting on Binance, which has been consistent with the Trust Principles [its in-house guidelines] of accuracy and freedom from bias.” The conversation moves on to those who have had savings wiped out by the crypto rout. “We absolutely have sympathy for anyone who has lost money in trading in any market, including stock markets,” says Zhao. He says financial literacy is key, and mentions his company’s own Binance Academy. He concedes there could be more failures in the crypto market. But he is unambiguous that there will be survivors. “There may be other failures. But crypto will stay, bitcoin will stay, ethereum will stay, BNB will stay. That part is quite certain.”","publicationTime":1656169218.000000000,"title":"Changpeng Zhao: tech chief in the eye of the cryptocurrency storm","id":"technology/2022/jun/25/changpeng-zhao-tech-chief-in-the-eye-of-the-cryptocurrency-storm"},{"body":"A US cryptocurrency broker and lender has filed for bankruptcy protection, becoming the latest domino to fall in the embattled digital asset market. Voyager Digital had suspended all withdrawals and trading last week but said “volatility and contagion” in the crypto markets had forced it into a Chapter 11 filing, which shields a business from creditors while it explores strategic alternatives. The cryptocurrency market has slumped since its $3tn (£2.5tn) peak last November to less than $1tn, with the decline accelerating in May when a multibillion dollar cryptocurrency, Terra, collapsed. The ensuing market rout triggered difficulties at a crypto-focused hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital, which owed money to Voyager and last week was lined up for liquidation. “The prolonged volatility and contagion in the crypto markets over the past few months, and the default of Three Arrows Capital on a loan from the company’s subsidiary, Voyager Digital LLC, require us to take deliberate and decisive action now,” Voyager’s chief executive, Stephen Ehrlich, said. In its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, Voyager, based in New Jersey, estimated that it had more than 100,000 creditors and somewhere between $1bn and $10bn in assets, and liabilities worth the same value. Voyager is a crypto firm that offers broking services – finding the best prices for cryptocurrencies that customers want to buy or sell – as well as borrowing digital assets from customers in exchange for yields of up to 12%, and then lending them out. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex business school, said Voyager’s troubles were part of a crypto credit crisis, but argued that was “not a bad thing at this stage”. “During the latest bitcoin bubble, firms offering unsustainable yields have proliferated too rapidly.” she said. “The shakedown we are witnessing now is welcomed by most authentic advocates of the digital asset ecosystem.” A filing with the bankruptcy court serving the southern district of New York showed that Alameda Research – a cryptocurrency trader – was Voyager‘s largest single creditor, with unsecured loans of $75m. Last week, Voyager said it had issued a notice of default to the Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital for failing to make required payments on a loan of 15,250 bitcoins (approximately $324m) and $350m worth of USDC, a stablecoin. Later that week, the hedge fund filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, which allows foreign debtors to shield US assets from creditors. Cryptocurrency is the term for a group of digital assets that share the same underlying structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. Bitcoin is the cornerstone digital asset, worth more than a third of the $900bn cryptocurrency market, but its value has slumped since November from almost $69,000 to $20,000. The sector’s supporters have said it represents a good investment because, for instance, it carries low fees and, unlike conventional currencies, is not tied to governments. Its detractors say a lack of regulatory oversight or implicit government support make it susceptible to scams and wild fluctuations in price.","publicationTime":1657104334.000000000,"title":"Cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital files for bankruptcy protection","id":"technology/2022/jul/06/cryptocurrency-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy-protection"}]
